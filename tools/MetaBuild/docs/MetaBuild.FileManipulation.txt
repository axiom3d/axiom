MetaBuild.FileManipulation AddIn
========================

Provides support for copying files and folders and creating archives
declaratively.  This is adequate for many simple purposes such as
ensuring that compiled binaries are copied into the right locations.

If your needs are more complex, you should instead override one of the
standard build target extension points, such as the AfterBuild target
and write your own sequence of MSBuild tasks within a module.

eg. <Target Name="AfterBuild">
      <!-- Do something interesting here... -->
    </Target>


File
----

Item Synopsis

  * File
    Specifies the path of one or more files to copy.
    May use the ** wildcard to copy files recursively.
    eg. foo\**\*.txt

Item Metadata

  * ImagePath (OPTIONAL)
    Specifies the path relative to $(ImageDir) to which the files
    and directories are to be copied during the Image pass.

  * DistPath (OPTIONAL)
    Specifies the path relative to $(DistDir) to which the files
    and directories are to be copied during the Dist pass.

  At least one of the above metadata items should be specified as otherwise
  the item will have no effect.

Item Syntax

  <ItemGroup>
    <File Include="docs\**\*.txt">
      <ImagePath>Project\docs</ImagePath>
    </File>
  </ItemGroup>


Zip
---

Item Synopsis

  * Zip
    Specifies the path of one or more files to archive into a ZIP file.
    May use the ** wildcard to copy files recursively.

Item Metadata

  * ImagePath (OPTIONAL)
    Specifies the path relative to $(ImageDir) of a ZIP file to create
    during the Image pass.

  * DistPath (OPTIONAL)
    Specifies the path relative to $(DistDir) of a ZIP file to create
    during the Dist pass.

  At least one of the above metadata items should be specified as otherwise
  the item will have no effect.

  * BaseDir (OPTIONAL)
    Specifies the base path for files that are to be added to the ZIP.
    The paths of the files within the archive will be made relative to
    the BaseDir.  So if the file path is "foo/bar/baz.txt" and BaseDir
    is "foo" then the file will be stored as "bar/baz.txt" in the ZIP.

    Default: $(ModuleDir)

Item Syntax

  <ItemGroup>
    <Zip Include="docs\**\*.txt">
      <ImagePath>Project\docs.zip</ImagePath>
      <BaseDir>docs</BaseDir>
    </Zip>
  </ItemGroup>
