MetaBuild.Module AddIn
======================

The Module AddIn provides the ability to recursively include or reference
modules to form complex hierarchies.

An included module is one that is considered a subcomponent of its parent
module.  It will be built in parallel with any other projects included
by the module.

A reference module is one that is considered a dependency of its parent
module.  It will be built before other projects in the module.  If multiple
modules are referenced, they are built in parallel with one another.


Module and ModuleReference
--------------------------

This item provides support for including and referencing other modules.

Item Synopsis

  * Module
    Represents an included module that should be built recursively as
    a subcomponent of this module.

  * ModuleReference
    Represents a referenced module that should be built recursively prior
    to building the other components of this module.

Item Metadata

  * Properties (OPTIONAL)
    Specifies custom MSBuild properties for the module.

  * Configuration (OPTIONAL)
    Specifies the build configuration.
    Default value: $(Configuration)

  * Platform (OPTIONAL)
    Specifies the build platform.
    Default value: $(Platform)

  Warning: The Properties, Configuration and Platform metadata must be set
           identically each time a module is referenced.  Otherwise the
	   module may end up being rebuilt multiple times.
