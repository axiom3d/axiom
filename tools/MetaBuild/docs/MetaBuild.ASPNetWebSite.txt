MetaBuild.ASPNetWebSite
=======================

Provides support for ASP.Net web site precompilation during the Build pass.

Building an ASP.Net web site differs somewhat from most projects.
Visual Studio does not create a project file for the web site.  Instead
most settings are stored in the Visual Studio solution file.

Consequently we must declare the other projects that are referenced by
the ASP.Net web site to ensure that they get built as required.
This is done using the custom <References> metadata property.  (See below)

ASPNetWebSiteProject
--------------------

Item Synopsis

  * ASPNetWebSite
    Provides the path of the ASP.Net web site directory within
    the source tree.  (Also known as its Physical Path.)

Item Metadata

  * ImagePath (REQUIRED)
    Specifies a path below $(ImageDir) to which the precompiled
    ASP.Net output should be copied.

  * VirtualPath (OPTIONAL)
    Specifies the virtual path to which the application is
    intended to be deployed.

    Default value: "/"

  * Debug (OPTIONAL)
    Specifies whether to generate debug output.

    Valid values: "true" or "false".

    Default value: "true" if $(Configuration) is "Debug" or not specified,
                   "false" otherwise

  * Updateable (OPTIONAL)
    Specifies whether to allow the website to be updated in place after
    it is published.

    Valid values: "true" or "false".

    Default value: "true" if $(Configuration) is "Debug" or not specified,
                   "false" otherwise

  * References (OPTIONAL)
    Specifies a series of items that describe references to other projects
    that the ASP.Net web site depends upon.  These references are specified
    exactly as if they appeared within some other MetaBuild model.

    You may use the property $(ModuleDir) to specify paths of references
    relative to the module's directory.

    Default value: (none)
