    ///		world matrix (or a collection of world matrices which are blended by weights), and must be 
    ///		renderable via a single render operation.

    ///		classes e.g. entities. Only once it is decided that the specific class is to be rendered is the abstract version
    ///		created (could be more than one per visible object) and pushed onto the rendering queue.
