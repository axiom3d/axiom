    /// 	Abstract base class representing a high-level program (a vertex or
    /// 	fragment program).
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	///    High-level programs are vertex and fragment programs written in a high-level
	///    language such as Cg or HLSL, and as such do not require you to write assembler code
	///    like GpuProgram does. However, the high-level program does eventually 
	///    get converted (compiled) into assembler and then eventually microcode which is
	///    what runs on the GPU. As well as the convenience, some high-level languages like Cg allow
	///    you to write a program which will operate under both Direct3D and OpenGL, something
	///    which you cannot do with just GpuProgram (which requires you to write 2 programs and
	///    use each in a Technique to provide cross-API compatibility). The engine will be creating
	///    a GpuProgram for you based on the high-level program, which is compiled specifically 
	///    for the API being used at the time, but this process is transparent.
	///    <p/>
	///    You cannot create high-level programs direct - use HighLevelGpuProgramManager instead.
	///    Plugins can register new implementations of HighLevelGpuProgramFactory in order to add
	///    support for new languages without requiring changes to the core engine API. To allow 
	///    custom parameters to be set, this class implement IConfigurable - the application
	///    can query on the available custom parameters and get/set them without having to 
	///    link specifically with it.
