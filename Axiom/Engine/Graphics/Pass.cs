	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
    ///    Rendering can be repeated with many passes for more complex effects.
    ///    Each pass is either a fixed-function pass (meaning it does not use
    ///    a vertex or fragment program) or a programmable pass (meaning it does
    ///    use either a vertex or a fragment program, or both). 
    ///    <p/>
    ///    Programmable passes are complex to define, because they require custom
    ///    programs and you have to set all constant inputs to the programs (like
    ///    the position of lights, any base material colors you wish to use etc), but
    ///    they do give you much total flexibility over the algorithms used to render your
    ///    pass, and you can create some effects which are impossible with a fixed-function pass.
    ///    On the other hand, you can define a fixed-function pass in very little time, and
    ///    you can use a range of fixed-function effects like environment mapping very
    ///    easily, plus your pass will be more likely to be compatible with older hardware.
    ///    There are pros and cons to both, just remember that if you use a programmable
    ///    pass to create some great effects, allow more time for definition and testing.
