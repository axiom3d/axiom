    ///		A billboard is a primitive which always faces the camera in every frame.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    ///		Billboards can be used for special effects or some other trickery which requires the
    ///		triangles to always facing the camera no matter where it is. The engine groups billboards into
    ///		sets for efficiency, so you should never create a billboard on it's own (it's ok to have a
    ///		set of one if you need it).
    ///		<p/>
    ///		Billboards have their geometry generated every frame depending on where the camera is. It is most
    ///		beneficial for all billboards in a set to be identically sized since the engine can take advantage of this and
    ///		save some calculations - useful when you have sets of hundreds of billboards as is possible with special
    ///		effects. You can deviate from this if you wish (example: a smoke effect would probably have smoke puffs
    ///		expanding as they rise, so each billboard will legitimately have it's own size) but be aware the extra
    ///		overhead this brings and try to avoid it if you can.
    ///		<p/>
    ///		Billboards are just the mechanism for rendering a range of effects such as particles. It is other classes
    ///		which use billboards to create their individual effects, so the methods here are quite generic.
