	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	///		Resources are generally passive constructs, handled through the
	///		ResourceManager abstract class for the appropriate subclass.
	///		The main thing is that Resources can be loaded or unloaded by the
	///		ResourceManager to stay within a defined memory budget. Therefore,
	///		all Resources must be able to load, unload (whilst retainin enough
	///		info about themselves to be reloaded later), and state how big they are.
	///
	///		Subclasses must implement:
	///		1. A constructor, with at least a mandatory name param.
	///			This constructor must set name and optionally size.
	///		2. The Load() and Unload() methods - size must be set after Load()
	///			Each must check & update the isLoaded flag.
