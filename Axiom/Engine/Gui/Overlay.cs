    ///    An overlay is a container for visual components (2D and 3D) which will be 
    ///    rendered after the main scene in order to composite heads-up-displays, menus
    ///    or other layers on top of the contents of the scene.
    ///    <p/>
    ///    An overlay always takes up the entire size of the viewport, although the 
    ///    components attached to it do not have to. An overlay has no visual element
    ///    in itself, it it merely a container for visual elements.
    ///    <p/>
    ///    Overlays are created by calling SceneManager.CreateOverlay, or by defining them
    ///    in special text scripts (.overlay files). As many overlays
    ///    as you like can be defined; after creation an overlay is hidden i.e. not
    ///    visible until you specifically enable it by calling Show(). This allows you to have multiple
    ///    overlays predefined (menus etc) which you make visible only when you want.
    ///    It is possible to have multiple overlays enabled at once; in this case the
    ///    relative ZOrder parameter of the overlays determine which one is displayed
     ///    on top.
     ///    <p/>
     ///    By default overlays are rendered into all viewports. This is fine when you only
     ///    have fullscreen viewports, but if you have picture-in-picture views, you probably
     ///    don't want the overlay displayed in the smaller viewports. You turn this off for 
     ///    a specific viewport by calling the Viewport.DisplayOverlays property.
