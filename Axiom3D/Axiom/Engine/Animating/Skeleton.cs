    /// <summary>
    ///		A collection of Bone objects used to animate a skinned mesh.
    ///	 </summary>
    ///	 <remarks>
    ///		Skeletal animation works by having a collection of 'bones' which are 
    ///		actually just joints with a position and orientation, arranged in a tree structure.
    ///		For example, the wrist joint is a child of the elbow joint, which in turn is a
    ///		child of the shoulder joint. Rotating the shoulder automatically moves the elbow
    ///		and wrist as well due to this hierarchy.
    ///		<p/>
    ///		So how does this animate a mesh? Well every vertex in a mesh is assigned to one or more
    ///		bones which affects it's position when the bone is moved. If a vertex is assigned to 
    ///		more than one bone, then weights must be assigned to determine how much each bone affects
    ///		the vertex (actually a weight of 1.0 is used for single bone assignments). 
    ///		Weighted vertex assignments are especially useful around the joints themselves
    ///		to avoid 'pinching' of the mesh in this region. 
    ///		<p/>
    ///		Therefore by moving the skeleton using preset animations, we can animate the mesh. The
    ///		advantage of using skeletal animation is that you store less animation data, especially
    ///		as vertex counts increase. In addition, you are able to blend multiple animations together
    ///		(e.g. walking and looking around, running and shooting) and provide smooth transitions
    ///		between animations without incurring as much of an overhead as would be involved if you
    ///		did this on the core vertex data.
    ///		<p/>
    ///		Skeleton definitions are loaded from datafiles, namely the .xsf file format. They
    ///		are loaded on demand, especially when referenced by a Mesh.
