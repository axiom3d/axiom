    ///     As described in the SceneManager class, SceneManagers are responsible
    ///     for organizing the scene and issuing rendering commands to the
    ///     RenderSystem. Certain scene types can benefit from different
    ///     rendering approaches, and it is intended that subclasses will
    ///     be created to special case this.
    ///     <p/>
    ///     In order to give applications easy access to these implementations,
    ///     the Root object has a GetSceneManager method to retrieve a SceneManager
    ///     which is appropriate to the scene type. However, this is the class
    ///     which implements this behavior and defines the scene types, because
    ///     it is intended that the Root class is not customized by everybody
    ///     (and it may be restricted access in the future).
