- Reverted the configuration changes to the EngineConfig.xml file is used again. This will stay 
  until the new configuration handers are completed.
- Completed RenderSystem Configuration Options handling, Now the ConfigWindow that opens with the Demos
  should actually work.
- Other random fixes and changes I can't remember
- Fixed some OverlayTemplate issues so YAT works properly.

- Fixed OpenGL bug that was causing it to not load.
- Fixed a couple of Overlay issues that were causing them to not display correctly.
- Updates to get the demos to work properly.
- Added MoveableText object for floating text.
- Fixed a bug in Rectangle2D
- DemoBrowser updated to be mostly run through Axiom. Just the ConfigDialog is SWF.

- Added a few new classes that were missing from the Ogre versions (ResourceGroupManager, ParticleSystemRenderer* )
- Added missing properties and Methods to the various ParticleSystems classes.
Notes: Work nearly complete on the Billboard/ParticleSystems of the main engine. Still needs some going over, but for now it builds again. 
One place in particular that needs some refactoring are the Events/Listeners of the ResourceGroupManager. Once I have everything
set I'll add the versioning tags. One thing I have noted in this process is that I am going to so love moving this code to .Net 2.0

- Started collapsing namespaces in Axiom.dll, all namespaces will become Axiom. This differs slightly from the Ogre version for now,
  I am planning on renaming it to Axiom.
- Completed namespace consolidation + assembly rename for Axiom.Engine

- Fixed compile errors in DX and OpenGL Renderers, incomplete, but it compiles.
  Hard coded the Autowindow settings to make things work. When I get to the RenderSystems, I'll fix this back up.

Notes:
	Was discussing some things on #Ogre3d, with wumpus, seems like the PlatformManagers are going to become extinct eventually
	I think they make a great place to encapsulate the platform specific code and eliminate the compile time options in the
	Renderers. e.g. The OpenGL Renderer can use either SDL or Win32, but in order to switch you have to flip some compile options
	I think Ogre is trying to get it so that if you are compiling on unix it will configure itself to use the native unix methods
	and do the same for the other platforms. Will need to think about how to proceed on this.

- Testing CruiseControl.Net for CI Build Server

2005-09-13 Michael Cummings [Borrillis]
- Fixed a couple of classes formatting
* Started work on Animations
- Moved enumerations into respective class files for easier location when updating from Ogre
- Updated Animation

2005-09-12 Michael Cummings [Borrillis]
- Added code changes for animation fixes and something else from forums
 
2005-09-04 Michael Cummings [Borrillis]
- Started work on new Demo browser for Axiom
  includes new configuration dialog similar to Ogre's.
  Also the browser itself will be done in CEGUI so it's cross platform
  
2005-09-01 Michael Cummings [Borrillis]
- Fixed some references for OpenGL RenderSystem in the Prebuild.xml
- Updated some of the dependencies in the dependencies folder.
- NB: If you switch from Windows/DirectX to SDL/OpenGL make sure you change the references from Tao.Platform.Windows 
  to Tao.SDL and remove the Win32 folder and add the SDL folder in the OpenGL Project.

- Added RealmForge.Utility to branch
- Updated Billboard and BillboardSet to Ogre 1.03
- Removed Axiom.Mathlib as it is now wholly contained in RealmForge.Utility, project files and using declarations are 
  updated.
- Added Documentation folder for the history file and anything else that describes this process.
- Added Axiom Dependencies directory and build tools to make building this branch easier, may or may not work yet.
  Tested with MSVC 2002, and it seems to work. You need to manually copy the Native Win32 deps into the bin/Debug or 
  bin/Release folders of the Axiom.Demo project.

2005-08-22 Michael Cummings [Borrillis]
- Reformatted Axiom code files using ReSharper and VS2005 for greater consistancy.
