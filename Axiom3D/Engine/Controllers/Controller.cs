    ///		Instances of this class 'control' the value of another object in the system.
    ///	</summary>
    ///	 <remarks>
    ///		Controller classes are used to manage the values of object automatically based
    ///		on the value of some input. For example, a Controller could animate a texture
    ///		by controlling the current frame of the texture based on time, or a different Controller
    ///		could change the color of a material used for a spaceship shield mesh based on the remaining
    ///		shield power level of the ship.
    ///		<p/>
    ///		The Controller is an intentionally abstract concept - it can generate values
    ///		based on input and a function, which can either be one of the standard ones
    ///		supplied, or a function can be 'plugged in' for custom behavior - see the <see cref="ControllerFunction"/> class for details.
    ///		Both the input and output values are via <see cref="ControllerValue"/> objects, meaning that any value can be both
    ///		input and output of the controller.
    ///		<p/>
    ///		While this is very flexible, it can be a little bit confusing so to make it simpler the most often used
    ///		controller setups are available by calling methods on the ControllerManager object.
