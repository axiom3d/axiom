    ///		to an animated entity, and make sure that attachment follows the parent entity's animation
    ///		(for example, a character holding a gun in his / her hand). This class simply identifies
    ///		attachment points on a skeleton which can be used to attach child objects. 
    ///		<p/>
    ///		The child objects themselves are not physically attached to this class; as it's name suggests
    ///		this class just 'tags' the area. The actual child objects are attached to the Entity using the
    ///		skeleton which has this tag point. Use <see cref="Entity.AttachObjectToBone"/> to attach
    ///		the objects, which creates a new TagPoint on demand.
