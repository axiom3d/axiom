    /// Pre-transforms and batches up meshes for efficient use as static geometry in a scene.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Modern graphics cards (GPUs) prefer to receive geometry in large
    /// batches. It is orders of magnitude faster to render 10 batches
    /// of 10,000 triangles than it is to render 10,000 batches of 10 
    /// triangles, even though both result in the same number of on-screen
    /// triangles.
    /// <br>
    /// Therefore it is important when you are rendering a lot of geometry to 
    /// batch things up into as few rendering calls as possible. This
    /// class allows you to build a batched object from a series of entities 
    /// in order to benefit from this behaviour.
    /// Batching has implications of it's own though:
    /// <ul>
    /// <li> Batched geometry cannot be subdivided; that means that the whole
    /// 	group will be displayed, or none of it will. This obivously has
    /// 	culling issues.
    /// <li> A single world transform must apply to the entire batch. Therefore
    /// 	once you have batched things, you can't move them around relative to
    /// 	each other. That's why this class is most useful when dealing with 
    /// 	static geometry (hence the name). In addition, geometry is 
    /// 	effectively duplicated, so if you add 3 entities based on the same 
    /// 	mesh in different positions, they will use 3 times the geometry 
    /// 	space than the movable version (which re-uses the same geometry). 
    /// 	So you trade memory	and flexibility of movement for pure speed when
    /// 	using this class.
    /// <li> A single material must apply for each batch. In fact this class 
    /// 	allows you to use multiple materials, but you should be aware that 
    /// 	internally this means that there is one batch per material. 
    /// 	Therefore you won't gain as much benefit from the batching if you 
    /// 	use many different materials; try to keep the number down.
    /// </ul>
    /// <br>
    /// In order to retain some sort of culling, this class will batch up 
    /// meshes in localised regions. The size and shape of these blocks is
    /// controlled by the SceneManager which contructs this object, since it
    /// makes sense to batch things up in the most appropriate way given the 
    /// existing partitioning of the scene. 
    /// <br>
    /// The LOD settings of both the Mesh and the Materials used in 
    /// constructing this static geometry will be respected. This means that 
    /// if you use meshes/materials which have LOD, batches in the distance 
    /// will have a lower polygon count or material detail to those in the 
    /// foreground. Since each mesh might have different LOD distances, during 
    /// build the furthest distance at each LOD level from all meshes  
    /// in that region is used. This means all the LOD levels change at the 
    /// same time, but at the furthest distance of any of them (so quality is 
    /// not degraded). Be aware that using Mesh LOD in this class will 
    /// further increase the memory required. Only generated LOD
    /// is supported for meshes.
    /// <br>
    /// There are 2 ways you can add geometry to this class; you can add
    /// Entity objects directly with predetermined positions, scales and 
    /// orientations, or you can add an entire SceneNode and it's subtree, 
    /// including all the objects attached to it. Once you've added everthing
    /// you need to, you have to call build() the fix the geometry in place. 
    /// <br>
    /// This class is not a replacement for world geometry (see 
    /// SceneManager.WorldGeometry). The single most efficient way to 
    /// render large amounts of static geometry is to use a SceneManager which 
    /// is specialised for dealing with that particular world structure. 
    /// However, this class does provide you with a good 'halfway house'
    /// between generalised movable geometry (Entity) which works with all 
    /// SceneManagers but isn't efficient when using very large numbers, and 
    /// highly specialised world geometry which is extremely fast but not 
    /// generic and typically requires custom world editors.
    /// <br>
    /// You should not construct instances of this class directly; instead, call
    /// SceneManager.CreateStaticGeometry, which gives the SceneManager the 
    /// option of providing you with a specialised version of this class if it
    /// wishes, and also handles the memory management for you like other 
    /// classes.
