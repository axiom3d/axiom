	/// <summary>
	/// An abstract class that contains a depth/stencil buffer.
	/// Depth Buffers can be attached to render targets. Note we handle Depth &amp; Stencil together.
	/// DepthBuffer sharing is handled automatically for you. However, there are times where you want
	/// to specifically control depth buffers to achieve certain effects or increase performance.
	/// You can control this by hinting Ogre with POOL IDs. Created depth buffers can live in different
	/// pools, or alltoghether in the same one.
	/// Usually, a depth buffer can only be attached to a RenderTarget only if it's dimensions are bigger
	/// and have the same bit depth and same multisample settings. Depth Buffers are created automatically
	/// for new RTs when needed, and stored in the pool where the RenderTarget should have drawn from.
	/// By default, all RTs have the Id POOL_DEFAULT, which means all depth buffers are stored by default
	/// in that pool. By chosing a different Pool Id for a specific RenderTarget, that RT will only
	/// retrieve depth buffers from _that_ pool, therefore not conflicting with sharing depth buffers
	/// with other RTs (such as shadows maps).
	/// Setting an RT to POOL_MANUAL_USAGE means Ogre won't manage the DepthBuffer for you (not recommended)
	/// RTs with POOL_NO_DEPTH are very useful when you don't want to create a DepthBuffer for it. You can
	/// still manually attach a depth buffer though as internally POOL_NO_DEPTH &amp; POOL_MANUAL_USAGE are
	/// handled in the same way.
	/// 
	/// Behavior is consistent across all render systems, if, and only if, the same RSC flags are set
	/// RSC flags that affect this class are:
	/// * RSC_RTT_SEPARATE_DEPTHBUFFER:
	/// The RTT can create a custom depth buffer different from the main depth buffer. This means,
	/// an RTT is able to not share it's depth buffer with the main window if it wants to.
	/// * RSC_RTT_MAIN_DEPTHBUFFER_ATTACHABLE:
	/// When RSC_RTT_SEPARATE_DEPTHBUFFER is set, some APIs (ie. OpenGL w/ FBO) don't allow using
	/// the main depth buffer for offscreen RTTs. When this flag is set, the depth buffer can be
	/// shared between the main window and an RTT.
	/// * RSC_RTT_DEPTHBUFFER_RESOLUTION_LESSEQUAL:
	/// When this flag isn't set, the depth buffer can only be shared across RTTs who have the EXACT
	/// same resolution. When it's set, it can be shared with RTTs as long as they have a
	/// resolution less or equal than the depth buffer's.
