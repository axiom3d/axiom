	/// Get the multithreading level to use.

	/// <remarks>
	/// In Ogre, OGRE_THREAD_SUPPORT preprocessor directive and multithreading work as follow:
	/// 
	/// OGRE_THREAD_SUPPORT = 0 No support for threading.
	/// 
	/// OGRE_THREAD_SUPPORT = 1 Thread support for background loading, 
	///     by both loading and constructing resources in a background thread.
	///     Resource management and SharedPtr handling becomes thread-safe,
	///     and resources may be completely loaded in the background.
	///     The places where threading is available are clearly marked,
	///     you should assume state is NOT thread safe unless otherwise
	///     stated in relation to this flag.
	///     
	/// OGRE_THREAD_SUPPORT = 2 Thread support for background resource preparation.
	///     This means that resource data can streamed into memory in the background,
	///     but the final resource construction (including RenderSystem dependencies)
	///     is still done in the primary thread. Has a lower synchronisation primitive
	///     overhead than full threading while still allowing the major blocking aspects
	///     of resource management (I/O) to be done in the background.
	///     
	/// In Axiom, we use the conditional compilation symbol AXIOM_THREAD_SUPPORT, as Ogre threading level 0,
	/// to enable or disable multithreading features.
	/// When enabled, the behaviour of Axiom (or multithreading level) can be controlled by AxiomThreadLevel.
	/// </remarks>
