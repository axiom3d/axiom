    ///	</summary>
    ///	<remarks>
    ///		A viewport is the meeting of a camera and a rendering surface -
    ///		the camera renders the scene from a viewpoint, and places its
    ///		results into some subset of a rendering target, which may be the
    ///		whole surface or just a part of the surface. Each viewport has a
    ///		single camera as source and a single target as destination. A
    ///		camera only has 1 viewport, but a render target may have several.
    ///		A viewport also has a Z-order, i.e. if there is more than one
    ///		viewport on a single render target and they overlap, one must
    ///		obscure the other in some predetermined way.
