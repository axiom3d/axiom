    /// <remarks>
    ///     Whilst for discrete geometry (i.e. movable/scene objects) groups of faces are
    ///     held in the SubMesh class, for immovable objects like scenery there
    ///     needs to ba little more flexibility in the grouping since the group is
    ///     likely to be a small part of a huge set of geometry. In addition, because
    ///     the faces are unmoving certain optimisations can be performed, e.g.
    ///     precalculating a world-coordinate bounding box and normal.
    ///     <p/>
    ///     Exactly how this class is used depends on the format of the large
    ///     static geometry used in the level. An example would be the use of this
    ///     class in the BspNode class for indoor levels.
    ///     For flexibility and efficiency, it is not assumed that this class holds
    ///     details of the vertices itself, or in fact that it holds the vertex indices
    ///     itself. Everything is manipulated via pointers so if you want this
    ///     class to point into a block of geometry data it can.
