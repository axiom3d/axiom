These dependencies should be extracted to the root of the Axiom source folder.  

Note:
- The prebuild file will automatically construct the solution files with references to the Dependencies/Managed folder.  
- All libraries in the Native folder will need to be manually copied to the output folder of your executable application for 
  them to be accessible from the Managed libraries.
