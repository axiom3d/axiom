    /// 	This class makes the usage of a vertex and fragment programs (low-level or high-level), 
    /// 	with a given set of parameters, explicit.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// 	Using a vertex or fragment program can get fairly complex; besides the fairly rudimentary
    /// 	process of binding a program to the GPU for rendering, managing usage has few
    /// 	complications, such as:
    /// 	<ul>
    /// 	<li>Programs can be high level (e.g. Cg, GLSlang) or low level (assembler). Using
    /// 	either should be relatively seamless, although high-level programs give you the advantage
    /// 	of being able to use named parameters, instead of just indexed registers</li>
    /// 	<li>Programs and parameters can be shared between multiple usages, in order to save
    /// 	memory</li>
    /// 	<li>When you define a user of a program, such as a material, you often want to be able to
    /// 	set up the definition but not load / compile / assemble the program at that stage, because
    /// 	it is not needed just yet. The program should be loaded when it is first needed, or
    /// 	earlier if specifically requested. The program may not be defined at this time, you
    /// 	may want to have scripts that can set up the definitions independent of the order in which
    /// 	those scripts are loaded.</li>
    /// 	</ul>
    /// 	This class packages up those details so you don't have to worry about them. For example,
    /// 	this class lets you define a high-level program and set up the parameters for it, without
    /// 	having loaded the program (which you normally could not do). When the program is loaded and
    /// 	compiled, this class will then validate the parameters you supplied earlier and turn them
    /// 	into runtime parameters.
    /// 	<p/>
    /// 	Just incase it wasn't clear from the above, this class provides linkage to both 
    /// 	GpuProgram and HighLevelGpuProgram, despite its name.
