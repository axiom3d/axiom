	/// <summary>
	///    Encapsulates a node in a BSP tree.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	///    A BSP tree represents space partitioned by planes . The space which is
	///    partitioned is either the world (in the case of the root node) or the space derived
	///    from their parent node. Each node can have elements which are in front or behind it, which are
	///    it's children and these elements can either be further subdivided by planes,
	///    or they can be undivided spaces or 'leaf nodes' - these are the nodes which actually contain
	///    objects and world geometry.The leaves of the tree are the stopping point of any tree walking algorithm,
	///    both for rendering and collision detection etc.<p/>
	///    We choose not to represent splitting nodes and leaves as separate structures, but to merge the two for simplicity
	///    of the walking algorithm. If a node is a leaf, the IsLeaf property returns true and both GetFront() and
	///    GetBack() return null references. If the node is a partitioning plane IsLeaf returns false and GetFront()
	///    and GetBack() will return the corresponding BspNode objects.

		///		visibility testing. There is a lookup table which is used to determine if one cluster of leaves
		///		is visible from another cluster. Whilst it would be possible to expand all this out so that
		///		each node had a list of pointers to other visible nodes, this would be very expensive in terms
		///		of storage (using the cluster method there is a table which is 1-bit squared per cluster, rounded
		///		up to the nearest byte obviously, which uses far less space than 4-bytes per linked node per source
		///		node). Of course the limitation here is that you have to each leaf in turn to determine if it is visible
		///		rather than just following a list, but since this is only done once per frame this is not such a big
