	/// Class defining a fixed function state.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// The Fixed Function Pipeline (FFP abbreviated) is one of currently two methods of modifying 
	/// the graphic output. The other is the Programmable Pipeline also known as Shaders.
	/// With the FFP you can choose one of those algorithms and several ways to set or 
	/// modify the factors. There is only a handful of predefined algorithms and you cannot 
	/// add handcrafted ones. Hence the name Fixed Function Pipeline.
	/// One of the big differences of XNA from previous versions of DirectX and OpenGL is that it 
	/// doesn't have support for the FFP - the motivation for this class cames from the needs
	/// of the XNA render system to support the FFP functions using shaders.
	/// Usually you will get better performance if you use the PP and not the FFP shader emulation.
	/// The second common use for this class is to generate the base code for a new shader.
	/// </remarks>
