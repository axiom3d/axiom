	/// <summary>
	///		Axiom assumes that there are seperate vertex and fragment programs to deal with but
	///		GLSL has one program object that represents the active vertex and fragment shader objects
	///		during a rendering state.  GLSL Vertex and fragment 
	///		shader objects are compiled seperately and then attached to a program object and then the
	///		program object is linked.  Since Ogre can only handle one vertex program and one fragment
	///		program being active in a pass, the GLSL Link Program Manager does the same.  The GLSL Link
	///		program manager acts as a state machine and activates a program object based on the active
	///		vertex and fragment program.  Previously created program objects are stored along with a unique
	///		key in a hash_map for quick retrieval the next time the program object is required.
