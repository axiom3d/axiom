namespace Axiom.ParticleSystems
{
	/// <summary>
	///		Abstract class defining the interface to be implemented by particle affectors.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	///		Particle affectors modify particles in a particle system over their lifetime. They can be
	///		grouped into types, e.g. 'vector force' affectors, 'fader' affectors etc; each type will
	///		modify particles in a different way, using different parameters.
	///		<para/>
	///		Because there are so many types of affectors you could use, the engine chooses not to dictate
	///		the available types. It comes with some in-built, but allows plugins or applications to extend the affector types available.
	///		This is done by subclassing ParticleAffector to have the appropriate emission behavior you want,
	///		and also creating a subclass of ParticleAffectorFactory which is responsible for creating instances
	///		of your new affector type. You register this factory with the ParticleSystemManager using
	///		AddAffectorFactory, and from then on affectors of this type can be created either from code or through
	///		.particle scripts by naming the type.
	///		<para/>
	///		This same approach is used for ParticleEmitters (which are the source of particles in a system).
	///		This means that the engine is particularly flexible when it comes to creating particle system effects,
	///		with literally infinite combinations of affector and affector types, and parameters within those
	///		types.
