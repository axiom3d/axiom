	/// <summary>
	///    Class encapsulating the rendering properties of an object.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	///    The Material class encapsulates ALL aspects of the visual appearance,
	///    of an object. It also includes other flags which
	///    might not be traditionally thought of as material properties such as
	///    culling modes and depth buffer settings, but these affect the
	///    appearance of the rendered object and are convenient to attach to the
	///    material since it keeps all the settings in one place. This is
	///    different to Direct3D which treats a material as just the color
	///    components (diffuse, specular) and not texture maps etc. This
	///    Material can be thought of as equivalent to a 'Shader'.
	///    <p/>
	///    A Material can be rendered in multiple different ways depending on the
	///    hardware available. You may configure a Material to use high-complexity
	///    fragment shaders, but these won't work on every card; therefore a Technique
	///    is an approach to creating the visual effect you are looking for. You are advised
	///    to create fallback techniques with lower hardware requirements if you decide to
	///    use advanced features. In addition, you also might want lower-detail techniques
	///    for distant geometry.
	///    <p/>
	///    Each technique can be made up of multiple passes. A fixed-function pass
	///    may combine multiple texture layers using multi-texturing, but they can
	///    break that into multiple passes automatically if the active card cannot
	///    handle that many simultaneous textures. Programmable passes, however, cannot
	///    be split down automatically, so if the active graphics card cannot handle the
	///    technique which contains these passes, the engine will try to find another technique
	///    which the card can do. If, at the end of the day, the card cannot handle any of the
	///    techniques which are listed for the material, the engine will render the
	///    geometry plain white, which should alert you to the problem.
	///    <p/>
	///    The engine comes configured with a number of default settings for a newly
	///    created material. These can be changed if you wish by retrieving the
	///    default material settings through
	///    SceneManager.DefaultMaterialSettings. Any changes you make to the
	///    Material returned from this method will apply to any materials created
	///    from this point onward.
