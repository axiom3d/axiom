	/// <remarks>
	///     Often it's useful to have temporary buffers which are used for working
	///     but are not necessarily needed permanently. However, creating and 
	///     destroying buffers is expensive, so we need a way to share these 
	///     working areas, especially those based on existing fixed buffers. 
	///     Classes implementing this interface represent a licensee of one of those 
	///     temporary buffers, and must be implemented by any user of a temporary buffer 
	///     if they wish to be notified when the license is expired.
