	///		Manages the target rendering window.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	///		This class handles a window into which the contents
	///		of a scene are rendered. There is a many-to-1 relationship
	///		between instances of this class an instance of RenderSystem
	///		which controls the rendering of the scene. There may be
	///		more than one window in the case of level editor tools etc.
	///		This class is abstract since there may be
	///		different implementations for different windowing systems.
	///
	///		Instances are created and communicated with by the render system
	///		although client programs can get a reference to it from
	///		the render system if required for resizing or moving.
	///		Note that you can have multiple viewpoints
	///		in the window for effects like rear-view mirrors and
	///		picture-in-picture views (see Viewport and Camera).
