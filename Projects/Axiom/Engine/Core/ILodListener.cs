	/// <summary>
	/// A interface class defining a listener which can be used to receive
	/// notifications of lod events.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// A 'listener' is an interface designed to be called back when
	/// particular events are called. This class defines the
	/// interface relating to lod events. In order to receive
	/// notifications of lod events, you should create a subclass of
	/// LodListener and override the methods for which you would like
	/// to customise the resulting processing. You should then call
	/// SceneManager::addLodListener passing an instance of this class.
	/// There is no limit to the number of lod listeners you can register,
	/// allowing you to register multiple listeners for different purposes.
	///
	/// For some uses, it may be advantageous to also subclass
	/// <seealso cref="RenderQueueListener"/> as this interface makes available information
	/// regarding render queue invocations.
	///
	/// It is important not to modify the scene graph during rendering, so,
	/// for each event, there are two methods, a prequeue method and a
	/// postqueue method.  The prequeue method is invoked during rendering,
	/// and as such should not perform any changes, but if the event is
	/// relevant, it may return true indicating the postqueue method should
	/// also be called.  The postqueue method is invoked at an appropriate
	/// time after rendering and scene changes may be safely made there.
