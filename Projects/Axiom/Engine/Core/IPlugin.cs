{
	/// <summary>
	///		Any class that wants to entend the functionality of the engine can implement this
	///		interface.  Classes implementing this interface will automatically be loaded and
	///		started by the engine during the initialization phase.  Examples of plugins would be
	///		RenderSystems, SceneManagers, etc, which can register themself using the
	///		singleton instance of the Engine class.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Axiom is very plugin-oriented and you can customize much of its behaviour
	/// by registering new plugins, dynamically if you are using dynamic linking.
	/// This class abstracts the generic interface that all plugins must support.
	/// Within the implementations of this interface, the plugin must call other
	/// Axiom classes in order to register the detailed customizations it is
	/// providing, e.g. registering a new SceneManagerFactory, a new
	/// MovableObjectFactory, or a new RenderSystem.
	/// <para />
	/// Plugins can be linked statically or dynamically. If they are linked
	/// dynamically (ie the plugin is in a DLL ), then you load the plugin by
	/// calling the Root.LoadPlugin method (or some other mechanism which leads
	/// to that call, e.g. app.config), passing the name of the DLL. Axiom
	/// will then call a global init function on that DLL, and it will be
	/// expected to register one or more Plugin implementations using
	/// Root.InstallPlugin. The procedure is very similar if you use a static
	/// linked plugin, except that you simply instantiate the Plugin implementation
	/// yourself and pass it to Root.InstallPlugin.
	/// </remarks>
	/// <note>
	/// Lifecycle of a Plugin instance is very important. The Plugin instance must
	/// remain valid until the Plugin is uninstalled. Here are the things you
	/// must bear in  mind:
	/// <ul><li>Create the Plugin anytime you like</li>
	/// <li>Call Root.InstallPlugin any time whilst Root is valid</li>
	/// <li>Call Root.UninstallPlugin if you like so long as Root is valid. However,
	/// it will be done for you when Root is destroyed, so the Plugin instance must
	/// still be valid at that point if you haven't manually uninstalled it.</li></ul>
	/// The install and uninstall methods will be called when the plugin is
	/// installed or uninstalled. The initialize and shutdown will be called when
	/// there is a system initialization or shutdown, e.g. when Root.Initialize
	/// or Root.Shutdown are called.
	/// </note>
