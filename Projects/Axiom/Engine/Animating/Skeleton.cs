	/// <summary>
	///		A collection of Bone objects used to animate a skinned mesh.
	///	 </summary>
	///	 <remarks>
	///		Skeletal animation works by having a collection of 'bones' which are
	///		actually just joints with a position and orientation, arranged in a tree structure.
	///		For example, the wrist joint is a child of the elbow joint, which in turn is a
	///		child of the shoulder joint. Rotating the shoulder automatically moves the elbow
	///		and wrist as well due to this hierarchy.
	///		<p/>
	///		So how does this animate a mesh? Well every vertex in a mesh is assigned to one or more
	///		bones which affects it's position when the bone is moved. If a vertex is assigned to
	///		more than one bone, then weights must be assigned to determine how much each bone affects
	///		the vertex (actually a weight of 1.0 is used for single bone assignments).
	///		Weighted vertex assignments are especially useful around the joints themselves
	///		to avoid 'pinching' of the mesh in this region.
	///		<p/>
	///		Therefore by moving the skeleton using preset animations, we can animate the mesh. The
	///		advantage of using skeletal animation is that you store less animation data, especially
	///		as vertex counts increase. In addition, you are able to blend multiple animations together
	///		(e.g. walking and looking around, running and shooting) and provide smooth transitions
	///		between animations without incurring as much of an overhead as would be involved if you
	///		did this on the core vertex data.
	///		<p/>
	///		Skeleton definitions are loaded from datafiles, namely the .xsf file format. They
	///		are loaded on demand, especially when referenced by a Mesh.
