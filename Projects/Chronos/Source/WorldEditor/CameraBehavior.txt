Camera behavior

Camera control consists of a camera "focus" node (F) and a camera node (C). Focus will be
on an object (O).

Rotating the focus node will cause a constant rotation of the camera. So long as the 
camera is set to autotrack the focus node, rotation will be smooth and constant.

Moving focus:

When shifting focus to another node, the following behavior should occur:

The focus node should shift to the new focus object's position. The camera node
will remain stationary, but will track the focus node.

If enabled, the camera node will concurrently zoom to the focus node. At the end of the
zoom operation, it should have the focus object filling the viewport (2xDistance)

Camera "y" should be the focus object's "y" after shift.
