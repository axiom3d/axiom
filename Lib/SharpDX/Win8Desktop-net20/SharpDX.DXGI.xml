            The  <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Adapter"/> interface represents a display sub-system (including one or more GPU's, DACs and video memory).	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            A display sub-system is often referred to as a video card, however, on some machines the display sub-system is part of the mother board.To enumerate the display sub-systems, use <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory.GetAdapter(System.Int32)"/>. To get an interface to the adapter for a particular device, use <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Device.GetAdapter(SharpDX.DXGI.Adapter@)"/>. To create a software adapter, use <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory.CreateSoftwareAdapter(System.Reflection.Module)"/>.

            <remarks>	
            SetPrivateData makes a copy of the specified data and stores it with the object.Private data that SetPrivateData stores in the object occupies the same storage space as private data that is stored by associated Direct3D objects (for example, by a Microsoft Direct3D?11 device through <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.SetPrivateData"/> or by a Direct3D?11 child device through <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceChild.SetPrivateData"/>).The debug layer reports memory leaks by outputting a list of object interface references along with their friendly names. The default friendly name is "&lt;unnamed&gt;". You can set the friendly name so that you can determine if the corresponding object interface reference caused the leak. To set the friendly name, use the SetPrivateData method and the well-known private data <see cref="T:System.Guid"/> (<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.CommonGuid.DebugObjectName"/>) that is in D3Dcommon.h. For example, to give pContext a friendly name of My name, use the following code:<code>	
             static const char c_szName[] = "My name";	
            hr = pContext-&gt;SetPrivateData( <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.CommonGuid.DebugObjectName"/>, sizeof( c_szName ) - 1, c_szName );	
            	
            </code>You can use <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.CommonGuid.DebugObjectName"/> to track down memory leaks and understand performance characteristics of your applications. This information is reflected in the output of the debug layer that is related to memory leaks (<see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Debug.ReportLiveDeviceObjects"/>) and with the event tracing for Windows events that we've added to Windows Developer Preview.

            <remarks>	
            Graphics applications can use the DXGI API to retrieve an accurate set of graphics memory  values on systems that have WDDM drivers. The following are the critical steps involved.Graphics driver model determination ? Because DXGI is only available on systems with WDDM drivers, the application must first confirm the driver model by using the following API.  	
            <code>	
             HasWDDMDriver()	
            { LPDIRECT3DCREATE9EX pD3D9Create9Ex = <c>null</c>; HMODULE             hD3D9          = <c>null</c>; hD3D9 = LoadLibrary( L"d3d9.dll" ); if ( <c>null</c> == hD3D9 ) { return false; } // /*  Try to create IDirect3D9Ex interface (also known as a DX9L interface). This interface can only be created if the driver is a WDDM driver. */ // pD3D9Create9Ex = (LPDIRECT3DCREATE9EX) GetProcAddress( hD3D9, "Direct3DCreate9Ex" ); return pD3D9Create9Ex != <c>null</c>;	
            } 	
            </code>	
                Retrieval of graphics memory values.? After the driver model is determined to be WDDM, the application can use the DirectX 10 or later API and DXGI to get the amount of graphics memory.  After creating a Direct3D device the following code can be used to obtain  a <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.AdapterDescription"/> structure containing the amount of available graphics memory.  	
            <code>	
             <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Device"/> * pDXGIDevice;	
            hr = g_pd3dDevice-&gt;QueryInterface(__uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Device"/>), (void **)&amp;pDXGIDevice);

            Note??You can  use CheckInterfaceSupport only to  check whether a Direct3D 10.x interface is supported, and only on Windows Vista SP1 and later versions of the operating system. If you try to use CheckInterfaceSupport to check whether a Direct3D 11.x and later version interface is supported, CheckInterfaceSupport returns <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.ResultCode.Unsupported"/>. Therefore, do not use CheckInterfaceSupport. Instead, to verify whether the operating system supports a particular interface, try to create the interface. For example, if you call the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateBlendState"/> method and it fails, the operating system does not support the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BlendState"/> interface.

            Graphics applications can use the DXGI API to retrieve an accurate set of graphics memory  values on systems that have WDDM drivers. The following are the critical steps involved.Graphics driver model determination ? Because DXGI is only available on systems with WDDM drivers, the application must first confirm the driver model by using the following API.  	
            <code>	
             HasWDDMDriver()	
            { LPDIRECT3DCREATE9EX pD3D9Create9Ex = <c>null</c>; HMODULE             hD3D9          = <c>null</c>; hD3D9 = LoadLibrary( L"d3d9.dll" ); if ( <c>null</c> == hD3D9 ) { return false; } // /*  Try to create IDirect3D9Ex interface (also known as a DX9L interface). This interface can only be created if the driver is a WDDM driver. */ // pD3D9Create9Ex = (LPDIRECT3DCREATE9EX) GetProcAddress( hD3D9, "Direct3DCreate9Ex" ); return pD3D9Create9Ex != <c>null</c>;	
            } 	
            </code>	
                Retrieval of graphics memory values.? After the driver model is determined to be WDDM, the application can use the DirectX 10 or later API and DXGI to get the amount of graphics memory.  After creating a Direct3D device the following code can be used to obtain  a <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.AdapterDescription"/> structure containing the amount of available graphics memory.  	
            <code>	
             <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Device"/> * pDXGIDevice;	
            hr = g_pd3dDevice-&gt;QueryInterface(__uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Device"/>), (void **)&amp;pDXGIDevice);

            <remarks>	
            An image-data object is a 2D section of memory, commonly called a surface. To get the surface from an output, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Output.CopyDisplaySurfaceTo(SharpDX.DXGI.Surface)"/>. Then, call QueryInterface on the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> object that <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Output.CopyDisplaySurfaceTo(SharpDX.DXGI.Surface)"/> returns to retrieve the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface2"/> interface.Any object that supports <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> also supports <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface2"/>.The runtime automatically creates an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface2"/> interface when it creates a Direct3D resource object that represents a surface. For example, the runtime creates an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface2"/> interface when you call <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateTexture2D"/> to create a 2D texture. To retrieve the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface2"/> interface that represents the 2D texture surface, call ID3D11Texture2D::QueryInterface. In this call, you must pass the identifier of <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface2"/>. If the 2D texture has only a single MIP-map level and does not consist of an array of textures, QueryInterface succeeds and returns a reference to the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface2"/> interface reference. Otherwise, QueryInterface fails and does not return the reference to <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface2"/>.You can call the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource1.CreateSubresourceSurface(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.Surface2)"/> method to create an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface2"/> interface that refers to one subresource of a stereo resource.

            <remarks>	
            This method is not supported by DXGI 1.0, which shipped in Windows?Vista and Windows Server?2008. DXGI 1.1 support is required, which is available on  Windows?7, Windows Server?2008?R2, and as an update to Windows?Vista with Service Pack?2 (SP2) (KB 971644) and Windows Server?2008 (KB 971512).After you use the GetDC method to retrieve a DC, you can render to the DXGI surface by using GDI.   The GetDC method readies the surface for GDI rendering and allows inter-operation between DXGI and GDI technologies.Keep the following in mind when using this method:You must create the surface by using the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.GdiCompatible"/> flag for a surface or by using the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags.GdiCompatible"/> flag for swap chains,  otherwise this method fails. You must release the device and call the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface1.ReleaseDC_(System.Nullable{SharpDX.Rectangle})"/> method before you issue any new Direct3D commands. This method fails if an outstanding DC has already been created by this method. The format for the surface or swap chain must be <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm_SRgb"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm"/>. On GetDC, the render target in the output merger of the Direct3D pipeline is unbound from the surface.   You must call the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.OutputMergerStage.SetRenderTargets"/> method on the device prior to Direct3D rendering after GDI rendering. Prior to resizing buffers you must release all outstanding DCs.You can also call GetDC on the back buffer at index 0 of a swap chain by obtaining an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface1"/> from the swap chain.   The following code illustrates the process.<code>	
             <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain"/>* g_pSwapChain = <c>null</c>;	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface1"/>* g_pSurface1 = <c>null</c>;	
            ...	
            //Setup the device and and swapchain	
            g_pSwapChain-&gt;GetBuffer(0, __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface1"/>), (void**) &amp;g_pSurface1);

            CreateSharedHandle only returns the NT handle when you  created the resource as shared and specified that it uses NT handles (that is, you set the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.SharedNthandle"/> and <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.SharedKeyedmutex"/> flags). If you  created the resource as shared and specified that it uses NT handles, you must use CreateSharedHandle to get a handle for sharing.  In this situation, you can't use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource.GetSharedHandle(System.IntPtr@)"/> method because it will fail.You can pass the handle that  CreateSharedHandle returns in a call to the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device1.OpenSharedResource1"/> method to give a device access to a shared resource that you created on a different device.Because the handle that  CreateSharedHandle returns is an NT handle, you can use the handle with CloseHandle, DuplicateHandle, and so on. You can call CreateSharedHandle only once for a shared resource; later calls fail.  If you need more handles to the same shared resource, call DuplicateHandle. When you no longer need the shared resource handle, call CloseHandle to close the handle, in order to avoid memory leaks.If you pass a name for the resource to lpName when you call CreateSharedHandle to share the resource, you can subsequently pass this name in a call to the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device1.OpenSharedResourceByName"/> method to give another device access to the shared resource. If you use a named resource, a malicious user can use this named resource before you do and prevent your app from starting. To prevent this situation, create a randomly named resource and store the name so that it can only be obtained by an authorized user. Alternatively, you can use a file for this purpose. To limit your app to one instance per user, create a locked file in the user's profile directory.If you  created the resource as shared and did not specify that it uses NT handles, you cannot use CreateSharedHandle to get a handle for sharing because CreateSharedHandle will fail.

The validity of the handle is tied to the lifetime of the underlying video memory. If no resource objects exist on any devices that refer to this resource, the handle is no longer valid. To extend the lifetime of the handle and video memory, you must open the shared resource on a device.

            <summary>	
            [Starting with Direct3D 11.1, we recommend not to use GetSharedHandle anymore to retrieve the handle to a shared resource. Instead, use <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource1.CreateSharedHandle(System.String,SharpDX.DXGI.SharedResourceFlags,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Win32.SecurityAttributes})"/> to get a handle for sharing. To use <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource1.CreateSharedHandle(System.String,SharpDX.DXGI.SharedResourceFlags,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Win32.SecurityAttributes})"/>, you  must create the resource as shared and specify that it uses NT handles (that is, you set the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.SharedNthandle"/> flag). We also recommend that you create shared resources that use NT handles so you can use CloseHandle, DuplicateHandle, and so on on those shared resources.]

GetSharedHandle only returns the handle when you  created the resource as shared (that is, you set the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.Shared"/> or <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.SharedKeyedmutex"/> flag).The handle that  GetSharedHandle returns is not an NT handle.

            Subresource surface objects implement the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface2"/> interface, which inherits from  <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface1"/> and indirectly <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/>.  Therefore, the GDI-interoperable methods of <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface1"/> work if the original resource interface object was created with the GDI-interoperable flag (<see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.GdiCompatible"/>).CreateSubresourceSurface creates a subresource surface that is based on the resource interface on which CreateSubresourceSurface is called. For example, if the original resource interface object is a 2D texture, the created subresource surface is also a 2D texture.You can use CreateSubresourceSurface to create parts of  a stereo resource so you can use Direct2D on either the left or right part of the stereo resource.

If you use a named resource, a malicious user can use this named resource before you do and prevent your app from starting. To prevent this situation, create a randomly named resource and store the name so that it can only be obtained by an authorized user. Alternatively, you can use a file for this purpose.

            <remarks>	
            The CreateSurface method creates a buffer to exchange data between one or more devices. It is used internally, and you should not directly call it.The runtime automatically creates an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> interface when it creates a Direct3D resource object that represents a surface. For example, the runtime creates an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> interface when it calls <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateTexture2D"/> or <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device.CreateTexture2D"/> to create a 2D texture. To retrieve the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> interface that represents the 2D texture surface, call ID3D11Texture2D::QueryInterface or ID3D10Texture2D::QueryInterface. In this call, you must pass the identifier of <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/>. If the 2D texture has only a single MIP-map level and does not consist of an array of textures, QueryInterface succeeds and returns a reference to the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> interface reference. Otherwise, QueryInterface fails and does not return the reference to <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/>.

            The values for the Priority parameter function as follows:Positive values increase the likelihood that the GPU scheduler will grant GPU execution cycles to the device when rendering. Negative values lessen the likelihood that the device will receive GPU execution cycles when devices compete for them. The device is guaranteed to receive some GPU execution cycles at all settings.To use the SetGPUThreadPriority method, you should have a comprehensive understanding of GPU scheduling. You should profile your application to ensure that it behaves as intended. If used inappropriately, the SetGPUThreadPriority method can impede rendering speed and result in a poor user experience.

            Create a factory by calling CreateDXGIFactory.Because a Direct3D device can be created without creating a swap chain, you might need to retrieve the factory that is used to create the device in order to create a swap chain.

            A software adapter is a DLL that implements the entirety of a device driver interface, plus emulation, if necessary, of kernel-mode graphics components for Windows. Details on implementing a software adapter can be found in the Windows Vista Driver Development Kit. This is a very complex development task, and is not recommended for general readers. Calling this method will increment the module's reference count by one. The reference count can be decremented by calling {{FreeLibrary}}. The typical calling scenario is to call {{LoadLibrary}}, pass the handle to CreateSoftwareAdapter, then immediately call {{FreeLibrary}} on the DLL and forget the DLL's {{HMODULE}}. Since the software adapter calls FreeLibrary when it is destroyed, the lifetime of the DLL will now be owned by the adapter, and the application is free of any further consideration of its lifetime.

            <remarks>	
            The combination of WindowHandle and Flags informs DXGI to stop monitoring window messages for the previously-associated window.If the application switches to full-screen mode, DXGI will choose a full-screen resolution to be the smallest supported resolution that is larger or the same size as the current back buffer size.Applications can make some changes to make the transition from windowed to full screen more efficient. For example, on a WM_SIZE message, the application should release any outstanding swap-chain back buffers, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.ResizeBuffers(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.Format,SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags)"/>, then re-acquire the back buffers from the swap chain(s). This gives the swap chain(s) an opportunity to resize the back buffers, and/or recreate them to enable full-screen flipping operation. If the application does not perform this sequence, DXGI will still make the full-screen/windowed transition, but may be forced to use a stretch operation (since the back buffers may not be the correct size), which may be less efficient. Even if a stretch is not required, presentation may not be optimal because the back buffers might not be directly interchangeable with the front buffer. Thus, a call to ResizeBuffers on WM_SIZE is always recommended, since WM_SIZE is always sent during a fullscreen transition.While windowed, the application can, if it chooses, restrict the size of its window's client area to sizes to which it is comfortable rendering. A fully flexible application would make no such restriction, but UI elements or other design considerations can, of course, make this flexibility untenable. If the application further chooses to restrict its window's client area to just those that match supported full-screen resolutions, the application can field WM_SIZING, then check against <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Output.FindClosestMatchingMode(SharpDX.DXGI.ModeDescription@,SharpDX.DXGI.ModeDescription@,SharpDX.ComObject)"/>. If a matching mode is found, allow the resize. (The <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Output"/> can be retrieved from <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.GetContainingOutput(SharpDX.DXGI.Output@)"/>. Absent subsequent changes to desktop topology, this will be the same output that will be chosen when alt-enter is fielded and fullscreen mode is begun for that swap chain.)Applications that want to handle mode changes or Alt+Enter themselves should call MakeWindowAssociation with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.WindowAssociationFlags.IgnoreAll"/> flag after swap chain creation. The WindowHandle argument, if non-<c>null</c>, specifies that the application message queues will not be handled by the DXGI runtime for all swap chains of a particular target <see cref="T:System.IntPtr"/>.  Calling MakeWindowAssociation with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.WindowAssociationFlags.IgnoreAll"/> flag after swapchain creation ensures that DXGI will not interfere with application's handling of window mode changes or Alt+Enter.Notes for Metro style appsIf a Metro style app calls MakeWindowAssociation, it fails with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.ResultCode.NotCurrentlyAvailable"/>.A Microsoft Win32 application can use MakeWindowAssociation to control full-screen transitions through the Alt+Enter key combination and print screen behavior for full screen.  For Metro style apps, because DXGI cannot perform full-screen transitions, Metro style app have no way to control full-screen transitions.

            <remarks>	
            If you attempt to create a swap chain in full-screen mode, and full-screen mode is unavailable, the swap chain will be created in windowed mode and <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.DXGIStatus.Occluded"/> will be returned.If the buffer width or the buffer height is zero, the sizes will be inferred from the output window size in the swap-chain description.Because the target output cannot be chosen explicitly when the swap-chain is created, you should not create a full-screen swap chain. This can reduce presentation performance if the swap chain size and the output window size do not match. Here are two ways to ensure that the sizes match:Create a windowed swap chain and then set it full-screen using <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.SetFullscreenState(System.Boolean,SharpDX.DXGI.Output)"/>. Save a reference to the swap chain immediately after creation, and use it to get the output window size during a WM_SIZE event. Then resize the swap chain buffers (with <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.ResizeBuffers(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.Format,SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags)"/>) during the transition from windowed to full-screen.If the swap chain is in full-screen mode, before you release it you must use SetFullscreenState to switch it to windowed mode. For more information about releasing a swap chain, see the "Destroying a Swap Chain" section of DXGI Overview.You can specify <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect"/> and <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags"/> values in the swap-chain description that pDesc points to. These values allow you to use features like flip-model presentation and content protection by using pre-Windows Developer Preview APIs.However, to use stereo presentation and to change resize behavior for the flip model, applications must use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory2.CreateSwapChainForHwnd(SharpDX.ComObject,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription1@,System.Nullable{SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFullscreenDescription},SharpDX.DXGI.Output)"/> method. Otherwise, the back-buffer contents implicitly scale to fit the presentation target size; that is, you can't turn off scaling.Notes for Metro style appsIf a Metro style app calls CreateSwapChain with full screen specified, CreateSwapChain fails.Metro style apps call the  IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForImmersiveWindow method to create a swap chain.

            <remarks>	
            A software adapter is a DLL that implements the entirety of a device driver interface, plus emulation, if necessary, of kernel-mode graphics components for Windows. Details on implementing a software adapter can be found in the Windows Vista Driver Development Kit. This is a very complex development task, and is not recommended for general readers.Calling this method will increment the module's reference count by one. The reference count can be decremented by calling FreeLibrary.The typical calling scenario is to call LoadLibrary, pass the handle to CreateSoftwareAdapter, then immediately call FreeLibrary on the DLL and forget the DLL's HMODULE. Since the software adapter calls FreeLibrary when it is destroyed, the lifetime of the DLL will now be owned by the adapter, and the application is free of any further consideration of its lifetime.

            Resource data formats which includes fully-typed and typeless formats. There is a list of format modifiers at the bottom of the page,  that more fully describes each format type.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            A few formats have additional restrictions.A resource declared with the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32 family of formats cannot be used simultaneously for vertex and texture data. That is, you may not create a buffer resource with the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32 family of formats that uses any of the following bind flags: <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.BindFlags.VertexBuffer"/>, <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.BindFlags.IndexBuffer"/>, <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.BindFlags.ConstantBuffer"/>, or <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.BindFlags.StreamOutput"/> (see <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.BindFlags"/>). <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R1_UNorm"/> is designed specifically for text filtering, and must be used with a format-specific, configurable 8x8 filter mode. When calling an HLSL sampling function using this format, the address offset parameter must be set to (0,0). A resource using a sub-sampled format (such as DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8_B8G8) must have a size that is a multiple of 2 in the x dimension. Format is not available in Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 10.1The following topics provide lists of the formats that particular hardware feature levels support:Hardware Support for Direct3D 11.1 Formats   Hardware Support for Direct3D 11 Formats   Hardware Support for Direct3D 10.1 Formats   Hardware Support for Direct3D 10 Formats   Hardware Support for Direct3D 10Level9 FormatsFor a list of the DirectXMath types that map to <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Format"/> values, see DirectXMath Library Internals.Format ModifiersEach enumeration value contains a format modifier which describes the data type.Format ModifiersDescription _FLOATA floating-point value; 32-bit floating-point formats use IEEE 754 single-precision (s23e8 format): sign bit, 8-bit biased (127) exponent,  and 23-bit mantissa. 16-bit floating-point formats use half-precision (s10e5 format): sign bit, 5-bit biased (15) exponent, and 10-bit mantissa. _SINTTwo's complement signed integer. For example, a 3-bit SINT represents the values -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. _SNORMSigned normalized integer; which is interpreted in a resource as a signed integer, and is interpreted in a shader as a signed normalized floating-point value in the range [-1, 1]. For an 2's complement number, the maximum value is 1.0f (a 5-bit value 01111 maps to 1.0f), and the minimum value is -1.0f (a 5-bit value 10000 maps to -1.0f). In addition, the second-minimum number maps to -1.0f (a 5-bit value 10001 maps to -1.0f). The resulting integer representations are evenly spaced floating-point values in the range (-1.0f...0.0f), and also a complementary set of representations for numbers in the range (0.0f...1.0f). _SRGBStandard RGB data, which roughly displays colors in a linear ramp of luminosity levels such that an average observer, under average viewing conditions, can view them on an average display.  <para>All 0's maps to 0.0f, and all 1's maps to 1.0f. The sequence of unsigned integer encodings between all 0's and all 1's represent a nonlinear progression in the floating-point interpretation of the numbers between 0.0f to 1.0f. For more detail, see the SRGB color standard, IEC 61996-2-1, at IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission).</para>	
             Conversion to or from sRGB space is automatically done by D3DX10 or D3DX9 texture-load functions. If the format has an alpha channel, the alpha data is also stored in sRGB color space.  _TYPELESSTypeless data, with a defined number of bits. Typeless formats are designed for creating typeless resources; that is, a resource whose size is known, but whose data type is not yet fully defined. When a typeless resource is bound to a shader, the application or shader must resolve the format type (which must match the number of bits per component in the typeless format). <para>A typeless format contains one or more subformats; each subformat resolves the data type. For example, in the R32G32B32 group, which defines types for three-component 96-bit data, there is one typeless format and three fully typed subformats.</para>

               _UINTUnsigned integer. For instance, a 3-bit UINT represents the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. _UNORMUnsigned normalized integer; which is interpreted in a resource as an unsigned integer, and is interpreted in a shader as an unsigned normalized floating-point value in the range [0, 1]. All 0's maps to 0.0f, and all 1's maps to 1.0f. A sequence of evenly spaced floating-point values from 0.0f to 1.0f are represented. For instance, a 2-bit UNORM represents 0.0f, 1/3, 2/3, and 1.0f.?New Resource FormatsDirect3D 10 offers new data compression formats for compressing high-dynamic range (HDR) lighting data, normal maps and heightfields to a fraction of their original size. These compression types include:Shared-Exponent high-dynamic range (HDR) format (RGBE) New Block-Compressed 1-2 channel UNORM/SNORM formatsThe block compression formats can be used for any of the 2D or 3D texture types ( Texture2D, Texture2DArray, Texture3D, or TextureCube) including mipmap surfaces. The block compression techniques require texture dimensions to be a multiple of 4 (since the implementation compresses on blocks of 4x4 texels). In the texture sampler, compressed formats are always decompressed before texture filtering.

            <para>8-bit per channel planar YUV 4:2:0 video resource format. This format is subsampled where each pixel has its own Y value, but each 2x2 pixel block shares a single U and V value. The runtime requires that the width and height of all resources that are created with this format are multiples of 2. The runtime also requires that the left, right, top, and bottom members of any <see cref="T:SharpDX.Rectangle"/> that are used for this format are multiples of 2. This format differs from <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.Nv12"/> in that the layout of the data within the resource is completely opaque to applications. Applications cannot use the CPU to map the resource and then access the data within the resource. You cannot use shaders with this format. Because of this behavior, legacy hardware that supports a non-NV12 4:2:0 layout (for example, YV12, and so on) can be used. Also, new hardware that has a 4:2:0 implementation better than NV12 can be used when the application does not need the data to be in a standard layout. </para>

            <remarks>	
            This enumeration is used by the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription"/> structure.This enumeration is also used by the  <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription1"/> structure.The primary difference between presentation models is how back-buffer contents get to the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) for composition. In the bitblt model, which is used with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.Discard"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.Sequential"/> values, contents of the back buffer get copied into the redirection surface on each call to <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.Present(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags)"/>. In the flip model, which is used with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.FlipSequential"/> value, all back buffers are shared with the DWM. Therefore, the DWM can compose straight from those back buffers without any additional copy operations.	
            In general, the flip model is the more efficient model. The flip model also provides more features, such as enhanced present statistics.Regardless of whether the flip model is more efficient, an application still might choose the bitblt model for the following reasons:<para>The bitblt model is the only way to mix GDI and DirectX presentation.</para>	
             <para>In the flip model, the application must create the swap chain with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags.GdiCompatible"/>, and then must use GetDC on the back buffer explicitly. After the first successful call to <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.Present(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags)"/> on a flip-model swap chain, GDI no longer works with the <see cref="T:System.IntPtr"/> that is associated with that swap chain, even after the destruction of the swap chain. This restriction even extends to methods like ScrollWindowEx.</para>	
              The flip model requires at least three window-sized buffers if the application uses child windows. For the bitblt model, this minimum is two buffers.

            Use a DXGI 1.1 factory to generate objects that enumerate adapters,  create swap chains, and associate a window with  the alt+enter key sequence for toggling to and from the full-screen display mode.If the CreateDXGIFactory1 function succeeds, the reference count on the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory1"/> interface is incremented. To avoid a memory leak, when you finish using the interface, call the IDXGIFactory1::Release method to release the interface.This entry point is not supported by DXGI 1.0, which shipped in Windows?Vista and Windows Server?2008. DXGI 1.1 support is required, which is available on  Windows?7, Windows Server?2008?R2, and as an update to Windows?Vista with Service Pack?2 (SP2) (KB 971644) and Windows Server?2008 (KB 971512).Note??Do not mix the use of DXGI 1.0 (<see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory"/>) and DXGI 1.1 (<see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory1"/>) in an application.

            Use a DXGI factory to generate objects that enumerate adapters, create swap chains, and associate a window with the alt+enter key sequence for toggling to and from the fullscreen display mode.If the CreateDXGIFactory function succeeds, the reference count on the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory"/> interface is incremented. To avoid a memory leak, when you finish using the interface, call the IDXGIFactory::Release method to release the interface.Note??Do not mix the use of DXGI 1.0 (<see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory"/>) and DXGI 1.1 (<see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory1"/>) in an application. Use <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory"/> or <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory1"/>, but not both in an application.The CreateDXGIFactory function does not exist for Metro style apps. Instead, Metro style apps use the  CreateDXGIFactory1 function.

The granularity at which the GPU can be preempted from performing its current task in the WDDM 1.1 or earlier driver model is a direct memory access (DMA) buffer for graphics tasks or a compute packet for compute tasks. The GPU can switch between tasks only after it completes the currently executing unit of work, a DMA buffer or a compute packet.A DMA buffer is the largest independent unit of graphics work that the WDDM scheduler can submit to the GPU. This buffer contains a set of GPU instructions that the WDDM driver and GPU use. A compute packet is the largest independent unit of compute work that the WDDM scheduler can submit to the GPU. A compute packet contains dispatches (for example, calls to the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.Dispatch"/> method), which contain thread groups. The WDDM 1.2 or later driver model allows the GPU to be preempted at finer granularity levels than a DMA buffer or compute packet. You can use the GetDesc2 method to retrieve the granularity levels for graphics and compute tasks.

            <remarks>	
            We recommend that windowed applications call IsWindowedStereoEnabled before they attempt to use stereo.  IsWindowedStereoEnabled returns TRUE if both of the following items are true:All adapters in the computer have drivers that are capable of stereo.  This only means that the driver is implemented to the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) for Windows?8 Consumer Preview (WDDM 1.2).  However, the adapter does not necessarily have to be able to scan out stereo. The current desktop mode (desktop modes are mono) and system policy and hardware are configured so that the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) performs stereo composition on at least one adapter output.The creation of a windowed stereo swap chain succeeds if the first requirement is met. However, if the adapter can't scan out stereo, the output on that adapter is reduced to mono.The Direct3D 11.1 Simple Stereo 3D Sample shows how to add a stereoscopic 3D effect and how to respond to system stereo changes.

            <remarks>	
            You can use composition swap chains with either DirectComposition?s IDCompositionVisual interface or XAML?s SwapChainBackgroundPanel class. For DirectComposition, you can call the IDCompositionVisual::SetContent method to set the swap chain as the content of a visual object, which then allows you to bind the swap chain to the visual tree. For XAML, the SwapChainBackgroundPanel class exposes a classic COM interface <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.ISwapChainBackgroundPanelNative"/>. You can use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.ISwapChainBackgroundPanelNative.SetSwapChain(SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain)"/> method to bind to the XAML UI graph.The <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.SetFullscreenState(System.Boolean,SharpDX.DXGI.Output)"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.ResizeTarget(SharpDX.DXGI.ModeDescription@)"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.GetContainingOutput(SharpDX.DXGI.Output@)"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain1.GetHwnd(System.IntPtr@)"/>, and IDXGISwapChain::GetCoreWindow methods aren't valid on this type of swap chain. If you call any of these methods on this type of swap chain, they fail.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            We recommend that windowed applications call IsWindowedStereoEnabled before they attempt to use stereo.  IsWindowedStereoEnabled returns TRUE if both of the following items are true:All adapters in the computer have drivers that are capable of stereo.  This only means that the driver is implemented to the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) for Windows?8 Consumer Preview (WDDM 1.2).  However, the adapter does not necessarily have to be able to scan out stereo. The current desktop mode (desktop modes are mono) and system policy and hardware are configured so that the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) performs stereo composition on at least one adapter output.The creation of a windowed stereo swap chain succeeds if the first requirement is met. However, if the adapter can't scan out stereo, the output on that adapter is reduced to mono.The Direct3D 11.1 Simple Stereo 3D Sample shows how to add a stereoscopic 3D effect and how to respond to system stereo changes.

            <remarks>	
            The AcquireSync method creates a lock to a surface that is shared between multiple devices, allowing only one device to render to a surface at a time.   This method uses a key to determine which device currently has exclusive access to the surface.When a surface is created using the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.ResourceOptionFlags.SharedKeyedmutex"/> value of the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.ResourceOptionFlags"/> enumeration,  you must call the AcquireSync method before rendering to the surface.  You must call the ReleaseSync method when you are done  rendering to a surface.To acquire a reference to the keyed mutex object of a shared resource, call the QueryInterface method of the resource and pass in  the UUID of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.KeyedMutex"/> interface.  For more information about acquiring this reference, see the following code example.The AcquireSync method uses the key as follows, depending on the state of the surface:On initial creation, the surface is unowned and any device can call the AcquireSync method to gain access.  For an unowned device, only a key of 0 will succeed. Calling the AcquireSync method for any other key will stall the  calling CPU thread. If the surface is owned by a device when you call the AcquireSync method, the CPU thread that called  the AcquireSync method will stall until the owning device calls the ReleaseSync method  using the same Key. If the surface is unowned when you call the AcquireSync method (for example, the last owning device has already called  the ReleaseSync method), the AcquireSync method will succeed if you specify the same key  that was specified when the ReleaseSync method was last called. Calling the AcquireSync method using  any other key will cause a stall. When the owning device calls the ReleaseSync method with a particular key, and more than one device is waiting after  calling the  AcquireSync method using the same key, any one of the waiting devices could be woken up first.  The order in which devices are woken up is undefined. A keyed mutex does not support recursive calls to the AcquireSync method.

            <remarks>	
            Direct3D devices require UNORM formats. This method finds the closest matching available display mode to the mode specified in pModeToMatch. Similarly ranked fields (ie. all specified, or all unspecified, etc) are resolved in the following order.  ScanlineOrdering Scaling Format Resolution RefreshRate  When determining the closest value for a particular field, previously matched fields are used to filter the display mode list choices, and  other fields are ignored. For example, when matching Resolution, the display mode list will have already been filtered by a certain ScanlineOrdering,  Scaling, and Format, while RefreshRate is ignored. This ordering doesn't define the absolute ordering for every usage scenario of FindClosestMatchingMode, because  the application can choose some values initially, effectively changing the order that fields are chosen. Fields of the display mode are matched one at a time, generally in a specified order. If a field is unspecified, FindClosestMatchingMode gravitates toward the values for the desktop related to this output.  If this output is not part of the desktop, then the default desktop output is used to find values. If an application uses a fully unspecified  display mode, FindClosestMatchingMode will typically return a display mode that matches the desktop settings for this output.   Unspecified fields are lower priority than specified fields and will be resolved later than specified fields.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            If an application wants to duplicate the entire desktop, it must create a desktop duplication interface on each active output on the desktop. This interface does not provide an explicit way to synchronize the timing of each output image. Instead, the application must use the time stamp of each output, and then determine how to combine the images.For DuplicateOutput to succeed, you must create pDevice from <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory1"/> or a later version of a DXGI factory interface that inherits from <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory1"/>.If the current mode is a stereo mode, the desktop duplication interface provides the image for the left stereo image only.By default, only four processes can use a <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication"/> interface at the same time within a single session. A process can have only one desktop duplication interface on a single desktop output; however, that process can have a desktop duplication interface for each output that is part of the desktop.If DuplicateOutput fails with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.ResultCode.Unsupported"/>, the application can wait for system notification of desktop switches and mode changes and then call DuplicateOutput again after such a notification occurs.  For more information, see information in desktop switch (EVENT_SYSTEM_DESKTOPSWITCH) and mode change notification (WM_DISPLAYCHANGE).

            <remarks>	
            GetDisplayModeList1 is updated from  GetDisplayModeList to return a list of <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.ModeDescription1"/> structures, which are updated mode descriptions.  GetDisplayModeList behaves as though it calls GetDisplayModeList1 because  GetDisplayModeList can return all of the modes that are specified by DXGI_ENUM_MODES, including stereo mode.  However, GetDisplayModeList returns a list of <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.ModeDescription"/> structures, which are the former mode descriptions and do not indicate stereo mode.The GetDisplayModeList1 method does not enumerate stereo modes unless you specify the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.DisplayModeEnumerationFlags.Stereo"/> flag in the Flags parameter.  If you specify <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.DisplayModeEnumerationFlags.Stereo"/>, stereo modes are included in the list of returned modes that the pDesc parameter points to.  In other words, the method returns both stereo and mono modes.In general, when you switch from windowed to full-screen mode, a swap chain automatically chooses a display mode that meets (or exceeds) the resolution, color  depth, and refresh rate of the swap chain. To exercise more control over the display mode, use GetDisplayModeList1 to poll the set of display modes that are validated  against monitor capabilities, or all modes that match the desktop (if the desktop settings are not validated against the monitor).The following example code shows that you need to call GetDisplayModeList1 twice. First call GetDisplayModeList1 to get the number of modes available, and second call GetDisplayModeList1 to return a description of the modes.<code>

            <remarks>	
            Direct3D devices require UNORM formats.FindClosestMatchingMode1 finds the closest matching available display mode to the mode that you specify in pModeToMatch.If you set the Stereo member in the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.ModeDescription1"/> structure to which pModeToMatch points to specify a stereo mode as input, FindClosestMatchingMode1 considers only stereo modes. FindClosestMatchingMode1 considers only mono modes if Stereo is not set.FindClosestMatchingMode1 resolves similarly ranked members of display modes (that is, all specified, or all unspecified, and so on) in the following order:ScanlineOrdering Scaling Format Resolution RefreshRateWhen FindClosestMatchingMode1 determines the closest value for a particular member, it uses previously matched members to filter the display mode list choices, and  ignores other members. For example, when FindClosestMatchingMode1 matches Resolution, it already filtered the display mode list by a certain ScanlineOrdering,  Scaling, and Format, while it ignores RefreshRate. This ordering doesn't define the absolute ordering for every usage scenario of FindClosestMatchingMode1, because  the application can choose some values initially, which effectively changes the order of resolving members.FindClosestMatchingMode1 matches members of the display mode one at a time, generally in a specified order.If a member is unspecified, FindClosestMatchingMode1 gravitates toward the values for the desktop related to this output.  If this output is not part of the desktop, FindClosestMatchingMode1 uses the default desktop output to find values. If an application uses a fully unspecified  display mode, FindClosestMatchingMode1 typically returns a display mode that matches the desktop settings for this output.   Because unspecified members are lower priority than specified members, FindClosestMatchingMode1 resolves unspecified members later than specified members.

GetDisplaySurfaceData1 was required because textures with an array size equal to 2 (ArraySize = 2) do not implement <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/>.You can call GetDisplaySurfaceData1 only when an output is in full-screen mode.

This is true regardless of target monitor rotation. A destination resource created by a graphics component (such as Direct3D 11) must be created with CPU write permission (see <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.CpuAccessFlags.Write"/>). Other surfaces can be created with CPU read-write permission (<see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.CpuAccessFlags.Read"/> | <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.CpuAccessFlags.Write"/>). GetDisplaySurfaceData1 modifies the surface data to fit the destination resource (stretch, shrink, convert format, rotate). GetDisplaySurfaceData1 performs the stretch and shrink with point sampling.

            <remarks>	
            A collaboration application can use <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication"/> to access the desktop image. <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication"/> is supported in Desktop Window Manager (DWM) on non-8bpp DirectX full-screen modes and non-8bpp OpenGL full-screen modes. 16-bit or 32-bit GDI non-DWM desktop modes are not supported.An application can use <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication"/> on a separate thread to receive the desktop images and to feed them into their specific image-processing pipeline.  The application uses <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication"/> to perform the following operations:Acquire the next desktop image. Retrieve the information that describes the image. Perform an operation on the image. This operation can be as simple as copying the image to a staging buffer so that the application can read the pixel data on the image. The application reads the pixel data  after the application calls <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface.Map(SharpDX.DXGI.MappedRect@,System.Int32)"/>. Alternatively, this operation can be more complex. For example, the application can run some pixel shaders on the updated regions of the image to encode those regions for transmission to a client. After the application finishes  processing each desktop image, it releases the image, loops to step 1, and repeats the steps. The application repeats these steps until it is finished processing desktop images.The following components of the operating system can generate the desktop image:The DWM by composing the desktop image A full-screen DirectX or OpenGL application An application by switching to a separate desktop, for example, the secure desktop that is used to display the login screenAll current <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication"/> interfaces become invalid when the operating system switches to a different component that produces the desktop image or when a mode change occurs.  In these situations, the application must destroy its current <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication"/> interface and create a new <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication"/> interface.Examples of situations in which <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication"/> becomes invalid are:Desktop switch Mode change Switch from DWM on, DWM off, or other full-screen applicationIn these situations, the application must release the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication"/> interface and must create a new <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication"/> interface for the new content.  If the application does not have the appropriate privilege to the new desktop image, its call to the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Output1.DuplicateOutput(SharpDX.ComObject)"/> method fails.While the application processes each desktop image, the operating system accumulates all the desktop image updates into a single update. For more information about desktop updates, see Updating the desktop image data.The desktop image is always in the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm"/> format.The <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication"/> interface does not exist for Metro style apps.

            <remarks>	
            When AcquireNextFrame returns successfully, the calling application can access the desktop image that AcquireNextFrame returns in the variable at ppDesktopResource.	
            If the caller specifies a zero time-out interval in the TimeoutInMilliseconds parameter, AcquireNextFrame verifies whether there is a new desktop image available, returns immediately, and indicates its outcome with the return value.  If the caller specifies an INFINITE time-out interval in the TimeoutInMilliseconds parameter, the time-out interval never elapses.Note??You cannot cancel the wait that you specified in the TimeoutInMilliseconds parameter. Therefore, if you must periodically check for other conditions (for example, a terminate signal), you should specify a non-INFINITE time-out interval. After the time-out interval elapses, you can check for these other conditions and then call AcquireNextFrame again to wait for the next frame.AcquireNextFrame acquires a new desktop frame when the operating system either updates the desktop bitmap image or changes the shape or position of a hardware reference.  The new frame that AcquireNextFrame acquires might have only the desktop image updated, only the reference shape or position updated, or both.

            <remarks>	
            The application must release the frame before it acquires the next frame.  After the frame is released, the surface that contains the desktop bitmap becomes invalid; you will not be able to use the surface in a DirectX graphics operation.For performance reasons, we recommend that you release the frame just before you call the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication.AcquireNextFrame(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.OutduplFrameInformation@,SharpDX.DXGI.Resource@)"/> method to acquire the next frame.  When the client does not own the frame, the operating system copies all desktop updates to the surface. This can result in wasted GPU cycles if the operating system updates the same region for each frame that occurs.  When the client acquires the frame, the client is aware of only the final update to this region; therefore, any overlapping updates during previous frames are wasted. When the client acquires a frame, the client owns the surface; therefore, the operating system can track only the updated regions and cannot copy desktop updates to the surface. Because of this behavior, we recommend that you minimize the time between the call to release the current frame and the call to acquire the next frame.

            You can create a swap chain in several ways. If your application uses Direct3D, create a swap chain when you create a device by 	
            calling <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.D3D10.CreateDeviceAndSwapChain"/> or <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.D3D11.CreateDeviceAndSwapChain"/>. If your application does not need Direct3D, create a swap chain for use directly with DXGI by 	
            calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory.CreateSwapChain(SharpDX.ComObject,SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription@,SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain)"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory2.CreateSwapChainForHwnd(SharpDX.ComObject,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription1@,System.Nullable{SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFullscreenDescription},SharpDX.DXGI.Output)"/>, IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForImmersiveWindow, or IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForCompositionSurface.

            <remarks>	
            DXGI may change the display state of a swap chain in response to end user or system requests.We recommend that you create a windowed swap chain and allow the end user to change the swap chain to full screen through SetFullscreenState; that is, do not set the Windowed member of <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription"/> to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/> to force the swap chain to be full screen. However, if you create the swap chain as full screen, also provide the end user with a list of supported display modes because a swap chain that is created with an unsupported display mode might cause the display to go black and prevent the end user from seeing anything. Also, we recommend that you have a time-out confirmation screen or other fallback mechanism when you allow the end user to change display modes.Notes for Metro style appsIf a Metro style app calls SetFullscreenState to set the display state to full screen, SetFullscreenState fails with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.ResultCode.NotCurrentlyAvailable"/>.You cannot call SetFullscreenState on a windowless swap chain that you created with IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForCompositionSurface.For the flip presentation model, after you transition the display state to full screen, you must call ResizeBuffers to ensure that your call to <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain1.Present1(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags,System.IntPtr)"/> succeeds.

            <remarks>	
            You can't resize a swap chain unless you release all outstanding references to its back buffers. You must release all of its direct and indirect references on the back buffers in order for ResizeBuffers to succeed.Direct references are held by the application after it calls AddRef on a resource.Indirect references are held by views to a resource, binding a view of the resource to a device context,  a command list that used the resource, a command list that used a view to that resource, a command list that executed another command list that used the  resource, and so on.Before you call ResizeBuffers, ensure that the application releases all references (by calling the appropriate number of Release invocations)  on the resources, any views to the resource, and any command lists that use either the resources or views, and ensure that neither the resource nor a view is  still bound to a device context.  You can use <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.ClearState"/> to ensure that all references are released. If a view is bound to a deferred context, you must discard the partially built command list as well (by calling ClearState, <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.FinishCommandListInternal"/>, then Release on the command list).   After you call ResizeBuffers, you can re-query interfaces via <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.GetBuffer(System.Int32,System.Guid,System.IntPtr@)"/>.For swap chains that you created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags.GdiCompatible"/>, before you call ResizeBuffers, also call <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface1.ReleaseDC_(System.Nullable{SharpDX.Rectangle})"/> on the swap chain's back-buffer surface to ensure that you have no outstanding GDI device contexts (DCs) open.We recommend that you call ResizeBuffers when a client window is resized (that is, when an application receives a WM_SIZE message).The only difference between ResizeBuffers in Windows Developer Preview and ResizeBuffers in Windows?7 is with flip presentation model swap chains that you create with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.FlipSequential"/> value set. In Windows Developer Preview, you must call ResizeBuffers to realize a transition between full-screen mode and windowed mode; otherwise, your next call to the Present method fails.

            ResizeTarget resizes the target window when the swap chain is in windowed mode, and changes the display mode on the target output when the swap  chain is in full-screen mode. Therefore, applications can call ResizeTarget to resize the target window (rather than a Microsoft Win32API such as SetWindowPos)  without knowledge of the swap chain display mode.If a Metro style app calls ResizeTarget, it fails with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.ResultCode.NotCurrentlyAvailable"/>.You cannot call ResizeTarget on a windowless swap chain that you created with IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForCompositionSurface.

            <remarks>	
            If you attempt to create a swap chain in full-screen mode, and full-screen mode is unavailable, the swap chain will be created in windowed mode and DXGI_STATUS_OCCLUDED will be returned. If the buffer width or the buffer height are zero, the sizes will be inferred from the output window size in the swap-chain description. Since the target output cannot be chosen explicitly when the swap-chain is created, you should not create a full-screen swap chain. This can reduce presentation performance if the swap chain size and the output window size do not match. Here are two ways to ensure the sizes match:  Create a windowed swap chain and then set it full-screen using <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.SetFullscreenState(System.Boolean,SharpDX.DXGI.Output)"/>. Save a reference to the swap-chain immediately after creation, and use it to get the output window size during a WM_SIZE event. Then resize the swap chain buffers (with <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.ResizeBuffers(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.Format,SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags)"/>) during the transition from windowed to full-screen.  If the swap chain is in full-screen mode, before you release it, you must use {{SetFullscreenState}} to switch it to windowed mode. For more information about releasing a swap chain, see the Destroying a Swap Chain section of {{DXGI Overview}}.

            <remarks>	
            An application can use Present1 to optimize presentation by specifying scroll and dirty rectangles. When the runtime has information about these rectangles, the runtime can then perform necessary bitblts during presentation more efficiently and pass this metadata to the Desktop Window Manager (DWM). The DWM can then use the metadata to optimize presentation and pass the metadata to indirect displays and terminal servers to optimize traffic over the wire. An application must confine its modifications to only the dirty regions that it passes to Present1, as well as modify the entire dirty region to avoid undefined resource contents from being exposed.For flip presentation model swap chains that you create with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.FlipSequential"/> value set, a successful presentation results in an unbind of back buffer 0 from the graphics pipeline, except for when you pass the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags.DoNotSequence"/> flag in the Flags parameter.Flip presentation model queueSuppose the following frames with sync-interval values are queued from oldest (A) to newest (E) before you call Present1.A: 3, B: 0, C: 0, D: 1, E: 0When you call Present1, the runtime shows frame A for 3 vertical blank intervals, then frame D for 1 vertical blank interval, and then frame E until you submit a new presentation. The runtime discards frames B and C.

            <remarks>	
            Temporary mono is a feature where a stereo swap chain can be presented using only the content in the left buffer.  To present using the left buffer as a mono buffer, an application calls the  <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain1.Present1(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags,System.IntPtr)"/> method with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags.StereoTemporaryMono"/> flag.  All windowed swap chains support temporary mono.

Possibly other error codes that are described in the DXGI_ERROR topic.</returns>	
            <remarks>	
            The background color affects only swap chains that you create with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Scaling.None"/> in windowed mode. You pass this value in a call to <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory2.CreateSwapChainForHwnd(SharpDX.ComObject,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription1@,System.Nullable{SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFullscreenDescription},SharpDX.DXGI.Output)"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory2.CreateSwapChainForCoreWindow(SharpDX.ComObject,SharpDX.ComObject,SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription1@,SharpDX.DXGI.Output)"/>, or  <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory2.CreateSwapChainForComposition(SharpDX.ComObject,SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription1@,SharpDX.DXGI.Output)"/>. Typically, the background color is not visible unless the swap-chain contents are smaller than the destination window.When you set the background color, it is not immediately realized. It takes effect in conjunction with your next call to the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain1.Present1(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags,System.IntPtr)"/> method. The DXGI_PRESENT flags that you pass to <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain1.Present1(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags,System.IntPtr)"/> can help achieve the effect that you require. For example, if you call SetBackgroundColor and then call <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain1.Present1(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags,System.IntPtr)"/> with the Flags parameter set to <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags.DoNotSequence"/>, you change only the background color without changing the displayed contents of the swap chain.When you call the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain1.Present1(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags,System.IntPtr)"/> method to display contents of the swap chain, <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain1.Present1(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags,System.IntPtr)"/> uses the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.AlphaMode"/> value that is specified in the AlphaMode member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription1"/> structure to determine how to handle the a member of the DXGI_RGBA structure, the alpha value of the background color, that achieves window transparency. For example, if AlphaMode is <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.AlphaMode.Ignore"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain1.Present1(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags,System.IntPtr)"/> ignores the a member of DXGI_RGBA.

            <remarks>	
            An application can use Present1 to optimize presentation by specifying scroll and dirty rectangles. When the runtime has information about these rectangles, the runtime can then perform necessary bitblts during presentation more efficiently and pass this metadata to the Desktop Window Manager (DWM). The DWM can then use the metadata to optimize presentation and pass the metadata to indirect displays and terminal servers to optimize traffic over the wire. An application must confine its modifications to only the dirty regions that it passes to Present1, as well as modify the entire dirty region to avoid undefined resource contents from being exposed.For flip presentation model swap chains that you create with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.FlipSequential"/> value set, a successful presentation results in an unbind of back buffer 0 from the graphics pipeline, except for when you pass the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags.DoNotSequence"/> flag in the Flags parameter.Flip presentation model queueSuppose the following frames with sync-interval values are queued from oldest (A) to newest (E) before you call Present1.A: 3, B: 0, C: 0, D: 1, E: 0When you call Present1, the runtime shows frame A for 3 vertical blank intervals, then frame D for 1 vertical blank interval, and then frame E until you submit a new presentation. The runtime discards frames C and D.

You set the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.FlipSequential"/> value in the SwapEffect member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription1"/> structure to specify that the swap chain uses the flip presentation model.The values in the PresentCount and PresentRefreshCount members indicate information about when a frame was presented on the display screen. You can use these values to determine whether a glitch occurred. The values in the SyncRefreshCount and SyncQPCTime members indicate timing information that you can use for audio and video synchronization or very precise animation. If the swap chain draws in full-screen mode, these values are based on when the computer booted. 	
            If the swap chain draws in windowed mode, these values are based on when the swap chain is created.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            A non-zero LastMouseUpdateTime indicates an update to either a mouse reference position or a mouse reference position and shape. That is, the mouse reference position is always valid for a non-zero LastMouseUpdateTime; however, the application must check the value of the PointerShapeBufferSize member to determine whether the shape was updated too.If only the reference was updated (that is, the desktop image was not updated), the AccumulatedFrames, TotalMetadataBufferSize, and LastPresentTime members are set to zero.An AccumulatedFrames value of one indicates that the application completed processing the last frame before a new desktop image was presented.  If the AccumulatedFrames value is greater than one, more desktop image updates have occurred while the application processed the last desktop update. In this situation, the operating system accumulated the update regions. For more information about desktop updates, see Desktop Update Data.A non-zero TotalMetadataBufferSize indicates the total size of the buffers that are required to store all the desktop update metadata.  An application cannot determine the size of each type of metadata.  The application must call the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication.GetFrameDirtyRects(System.Int32,SharpDX.Rectangle[],System.Int32@)"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication.GetFrameMoveRects(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.OutduplMoveRect[],System.Int32@)"/>, or <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication.GetFramePointerShape(System.Int32,System.IntPtr,System.Int32@,SharpDX.DXGI.OutduplPointerShapeInformation@)"/> method to obtain information about each type of metadata.Note??To correct visual effects, an application must process the move region data before it processes the dirty rectangles.

            <remarks>	
            The scroll rectangle and the list of dirty rectangles could overlap.  In this situation, the dirty rectangles take priority. Applications can then have pieces of dynamic content on top of a scrolled area. For example, an application could scroll a page and play video at the same time.The following diagram and coordinates illustrate this example.DirtyRectsCount = 2	
            pDirtyRects[ 0 ] = { 10, 30, 40, 50 } // Video	
            pDirtyRects[ 1 ] = { 0, 70, 50, 80 } // New line	
            *pScrollRect = { 0, 0, 50, 70 }	
            *pScrollOffset = { 0, -10 }Parts of the previous frame and content that the application renders are combined to produce the final frame that the operating system presents on the display screen. Most of the window is scrolled from the previous frame. The  application must update the video frame with the new chunk of content that appears due to scrolling.The dashed rectangle shows the scroll rectangle in the current frame. The scroll rectangle is  specified by the pScrollRect member.	
            The arrow shows the scroll offset. The scroll offset is specified by the pScrollOffset member.	
            Filled rectangles show dirty rectangles that the application updated with new content. The filled rectangles are specified by the DirtyRectsCount and pDirtyRects members.The scroll rectangle and offset are not supported for the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.Discard"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.Sequential"/> present option. Dirty rectangles and scroll rectangle are not supported for multisampled swap chains.The actual implementation of composition and necessary bitblts is different for the bitblt model and the flip model.

            <remarks>	
            Note??You cannot cast a <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription1"/> to a <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription"/> and vice versa. An application must explicitly use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain1.GetDescription1(SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription1@)"/> method to retrieve the newer version of the swap-chain description structure.In full-screen mode, there is a dedicated front buffer; in windowed mode, the desktop is the front buffer.For a flip-model swap chain (that is, a swap chain that has the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.FlipSequential"/> value set in the SwapEffect member), you must set the Format member to <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R16G16B16A16_Float"/>, <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm"/>, or <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R8G8B8A8_UNorm"/>; you must set the Count member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SampleDescription"/> structure that the SampleDesc member specifies to one and the Quality member of <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SampleDescription"/> to zero because multiple sample antialiasing (MSAA) is not supported; you must set the BufferCount member to from two to sixteen. For more info about flip-model swap chain, see DXGI Flip Model.
