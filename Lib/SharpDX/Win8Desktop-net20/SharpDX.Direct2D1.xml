            Creating <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/> ObjectsTo create a bitmap, use one of the following methods of the render target on which the bitmap will be drawn:<see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.CreateBitmap(SharpDX.DrawingSize,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapProperties,SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap)"/>   <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.CreateBitmapFromWicBitmap(SharpDX.WIC.BitmapSource,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapProperties},SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap@)"/>For information about the pixel formats supported by Direct2D bitmaps, see Supported Pixel Formats and Alpha Modes.An <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/> is a device-dependent resource: your application should create bitmaps after it initializes the render target with which the bitmap will be used, and recreate the bitmap whenever the render target needs recreated. (For more information about resources, see Resources Overview.)

            <remarks>	
            An <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Image"/> is abstract.  Concrete instances can be created through <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.DeviceContext.CreateEffect(System.Guid,SharpDX.Direct2D1.Effect)"/> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.DeviceContext.CreateBitmap(SharpDX.DrawingSize,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapProperties1,SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap1)"/>.Images are evaluated lazily. If the type of image passed in is concrete, then the image can be directly sampled from. Other images can act only as a source of pixels and can produce content only as a result of calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.DeviceContext.DrawImage(SharpDX.Direct2D1.Effect,SharpDX.DrawingPointF,SharpDX.Direct2D1.InterpolationMode,SharpDX.Direct2D1.CompositeMode)"/>.

            This method does not update the size of the current bitmap. If the contents of the source bitmap do not fit in the current bitmap, this method fails. Also, note that this method does not perform format conversion; the two bitmap formats should match.If this method is passed invalid input (such as an invalid destination rectangle), can produce unpredictable results, such as a distorted image or device failure.Calling this method may cause the current batch to flush if the bitmap is active in the batch.

            A bitmap brush is used to fill a geometry with a bitmap. Like all brushes, it defines an infinite plane of content. Because bitmaps are finite, the brush relies on an "extend mode" to determine how the plane is filled horizontally and vertically.Creating <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapBrush"/> ObjectsTo create a bitmap brush, use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.CreateBitmapBrush(SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapBrushProperties},System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct2D1.BrushProperties},SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapBrush)"/> method.An <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapBrush"/> is a device-dependent resource: your application should create bitmap brushes after it initializes the render target with which the bitmap brush will be used, and recreate the bitmap brush whenever the render target needs recreated. (For more information about resources, see Resources Overview.)

            An <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapBrush"/> is a device-dependent resource: your application should create bitmap brushes after it initializes the render target with which the bitmap brush will be used, and recreate the bitmap brush whenever the render target needs recreated. (For more information about resources, see Resources Overview.)Brush space in Direct2D is specified differently than in XPS and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). In Direct2D, brush space is not relative to the object being drawn, but rather is the current coordinate system of the render target, transformed by the brush transform, if present. To paint an object as it would be painted by a WPF brush, you must translate the brush space origin to the upper-left corner of the object's bounding box, and then scale the brush space so that the base tile fills the bounding box of the object.For more information about brushes, see the Brushes Overview.

            <remarks>	
            When you paint with a brush, it paints in the coordinate space of the render target. Brushes do not automatically position themselves to align with the object being painted; by default, they begin painting at the origin (0, 0) of the render target.You can "move" the gradient defined by an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.LinearGradientBrush"/> to a target area by setting its start point and end point. Likewise, you can move the gradient defined by an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RadialGradientBrush"/> by changing its center and radii.To align the content of an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapBrush"/> to the area being painted, you can use the SetTransform method to translate the bitmap to the desired location. This transform only affects the brush; it does not affect any other content drawn by the render target.The following illustrations show the effect of using an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapBrush"/> to fill a rectangle located at (100, 100). The illustration on the left illustration shows the result of filling the rectangle without transforming the brush: the bitmap is drawn at the render target's origin. As a result, only a portion of the bitmap appears in the rectangle.The illustration on the right shows the result of transforming the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapBrush"/> so that its content is shifted 50 pixels to the right and 50 pixels down. The bitmap now fills the rectangle.

            This method specifies the bitmap source that this brush uses to paint. The bitmap is not resized or rescaled automatically to fit the geometry that it fills. The bitmap stays at its native size. To resize or translate the bitmap, use the SetTransform method to apply  a transform to the brush.The native size of a bitmap is the width and height in bitmap pixels, divided by the bitmap DPI. This native size forms the base tile of the brush. To tile a subregion of the bitmap, you must generate a new bitmap containing this subregion and use SetBitmap to apply it to the brush.

            The command list does not include static copies of resources with the recorded set of commands. All bitmaps, effects, and geometries are stored as references to the actual resource and all the brushes are stored by value. All the resource creation and destruction happens outside of the command list. The following table  	lists resources and how they are treated inside of a command list.ResourceHow it is treated by the command list Solid-color brushPassed by value. Bitmap brushThe brush is passed by value but the bitmap that is used to create the brush is in fact referenced. Gradient brushes ? both linear and radial gradientThe brush is passed by value but the gradient stop collection itself is referenced. The gradient stop collection object is immutable.  BitmapsPassed by reference. Drawing state blockThe actual state on the device context is converted into set functions like set transform and is passed by value. GeometryImmutable object passed by value. Stroke styleImmutable object passed by value. MeshImmutable object passed by value.?Using a CommandList as a TargetThe following pseudocode illustrates the different cases where a target is set as either a command list or as a bitmap.//create a D2D device from an already created DXGI device 	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Device"/> *pD2D1Device;	
            pD2D1Factory-&gt;CreateDevice(pDxgiDevice, &amp;pD2D1Device); //create a D2D device context from the D2D device	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.DeviceContext"/> *pD2D1DeviceContext;

            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;CreateCommandList(&amp;pCommandList1); //CreateBitmap	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/> *pBitmap1;	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/> *pBitmap2;	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;CreateBitmap(?, &amp;pBitmap1);	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;CreateBitmap(?, &amp;pBitmap2); //Set the bitmap as the target	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;SetTarget(pBitmap1);	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;BeginDraw();	
            RenderMyVectorContent(pD2D1DeviceContext);	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;EndDraw(); //Set the command list as the target	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;SetTarget(pCommandList1);	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;BeginDraw();	
            RenderMyVectorContent(pD2D1DeviceContext);	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;EndDraw(); //Drawing a command list to a bitmap target	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;SetTarget(pBitmap2);	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;BeginDraw();	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;DrawImage(pCommandList1);	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;EndDraw();Set the bitmap as the target: In this case, all contents rendered to the bitmap are rasterized. If this bitmap is used somewhere else, it will not be resolution independent and if a transformation like High Quality Scale is used, it will not maintain fidelity. Set the command list as the target: In this case, instead of the scene being rasterized, all of the commands are recorded. When the command list is used later for screen drawing using <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.DeviceContext.DrawImage(SharpDX.Direct2D1.Effect,SharpDX.DrawingPointF,SharpDX.Direct2D1.InterpolationMode,SharpDX.Direct2D1.CompositeMode)"/> or passed to an XPS print control, the vector content is replayed with no loss of fidelity. Drawing a command list to a bitmap target: In this case because the target is a bitmap, the command list is drawn to the bitmap and is no longer resolution independent.The only way to retain vector content for later playback with full fidelity is to set the target type as a command list. When a bitmap is set as a target, any drawing on that target will get rasterized.Using a CommandList to Create a BrushCommand lists are a good way to support pattern brushes, because they are capable of retaining fidelity on replay. The desired pattern can be stored as a command list, which can be used to create an image brush. This brush can then be used to paint paths.The type of brush that supports filling a path with a command list is called an image brush.The following psuedocode illustrates the process of using a command list with an image brush.//Draw the pattern to the command list	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.CommandList"/> *pCommandList;	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;SetTarget(pCommandList);	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;BeginDraw();	
            DrawMyPattern(pD2D1DeviceContext);	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;EndDraw(); //Create the image brush from the command list	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.ImageBrush"/> *pImageBrush;	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;CreateImageBrush( pCommandList,  pImageBrushProperties, pBrushProperties, &amp;pImageBrush); //Fill the ellipse with the pattern brush	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;SetTarget(pTargetBitmap);	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;BeginDraw();	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;FillEllipse(pEllipse, pImageBrush);	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;EndDraw();Because the brush accepts an image, it has the following other benefits as well:Because the output of an effect graph is an image, this image can be used to create an image brush, which effectively provides the capability of using an effect as a fill. Because the command list is a type of image, vector content can be inserted into an effect graph and can also be tiled or operated on. For example, a large copyright notice can be inserted over a graph with a virtualized image and then encoded.Using a CommandList as a Replacement for a Compatible Render TargetCompatible render targets are used very often for off-screen rendering to an intermediate bitmap that is later composited with the actual scene. Especially in the case of printing, using compatible render targets will increase the memory footprint because everything will be rasterized and sent to XPS instead of retaining the actual primitives. In this scenario, a developer is better off replacing the compatible render target with an intermediate command list. 	
            The following pseudo code illustrates this point.pD2D1Device-&gt;CreateDeviceContext(&amp;pD2D1DeviceContext);	
            pRenderTarget-&gt;CreateCompatibleRenderTarget(?, &amp;pCompatibleRenderTarget); //render to the compatible render target	
            pCompatibleRenderTarget-&gt;BeginDraw();	
            RenderMyScene1(pCompatibleRenderTarget);	
            pCompatibleRenderTarget-&gt;EndDraw(); //get the bitmap from the compatible render target	
            pCompatibleRenderTarget-&gt;GetBitmap(pCompatBitmap); //draw this bitmap on the device context	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;SetTarget(pTargetBitmap)	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;BeginDraw();	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;DrawBitmap(pCompatBitmap);	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;EndDraw(); //draw something else on the compatible render target	
            pCompatibleRenderTarget-&gt;BeginDraw();	
            pCompatibleRenderTarget-&gt;Clear();	
            pCompatibleRenderTarget&gt;RenderScene2();	
            pCompatibleRenderTarget-&gt;EndDraw(); //get the bitmap from the compatible render target	
            pCompatibleRenderTarget-&gt;GetBitmap(pCompatBitmap); //draw this bitmap on the device context

            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;BeginDraw();	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;DrawBitmap(pCompatBitmap);	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;EndDraw(); //Use a command list instead for better quality and performance  //store the original target	
            pOriginalTarget = pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;GetTarget(); pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;CreateCommandList(pCommandList1); //draw to command list 1	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;SetTarget(pCommandList1);

            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;BeginDraw();	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;DrawImage(pCommandList2);	
            pD2D1DeviceContext-&gt;EndDraw();Working with Other APIsDirect2D employs a simple model when interoperating with GDI and Direct3D/DXGI APIs. The command list does not record these commands. It instead rasterizes the contents in place and stores them as an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/>. Because the contents are rasterized, these interop points do not maintain high fidelity.GDI: The command sink interface does not support Get/ReleaseDC() calls. When a call to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GdiInteropRenderTarget.ReleaseDC"/> is made, Direct2D renders the contents of the updated  region into a D2D1Bitmap. This will be replayed as an aliased DrawBitmap call with a copy composite mode. 	
            To rasterize the bitmap at the correct DPI, at the time of playback of the commands, whatever DPI value is set using the SetDPI() function is used. This is the only case where the sink respects the SetDPI() call.DX: Direct3D cannot render directly to the command list. To render Direct3D content in this case, the application can call DrawBitmap with the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/> backed by a Direct3D surface.

            If the output precision of the transform is not specified, then it will default to the precision specified on the Direct2D device context. If the default precision on the context is not specified, then the output precision will be the maximum of the precision of the inputs. The maximum of 16bpc UNORM and 16bpc FLOAT is 32bpc FLOAT.Similar rules apply to the channel depth. The output channel depth will match the maximum of the input channel depths if the channel depth is <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.ChannelDepth.Default"/>. If any input buffer is 4-channel, the output buffer will also be 4-channel; otherwise, the intermediate buffer will be allocated with the specified channel depth.There is no global output channel depth; this is always left to the control of the transforms.

            <remarks>	
            The <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.CommandSink"/> can be implemented to receive a play-back of the commands recorded in a command list. This interface is typically used for transforming the command list into another format  where some degree of conversion between the Direct2D primitives and the target format is required.The <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.CommandSink"/> interface does not have any resource creation methods. The resources are logically bound to the Direct2D device on which the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.CommandList"/> was created and will be passed in to the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.CommandSink"/> implementation.Not all methods implemented by <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.DeviceContext"/> are present.

            This method is called by the renderer when the effect is within an effect graph that is drawn.The method will be called:If the effect has been initialized but has not previously been drawn. If an effect property has been set since the last draw call. If the context state has changed since the effect was last drawn.The method will not otherwise be called. The transforms created by the effect will be called to handle their input and output rectangles for every draw call.Most effects defer creating any resources or specifying a topology until this call is made. They store their properties and map them to a concrete set of rendering techniques when first drawn.

            This method is called by the renderer when the effect is within an effect graph that is drawn.The method will be called:If the effect has been initialized but has not previously been drawn. If an effect property has been set since the last draw call. If the context state has changed since the effect was last drawn.The method will not otherwise be called. The transforms created by the effect will be called to handle their input and output rectangles for every draw call.Most effects defer creating any resources or specifying a topology until this call is made. They store their properties and map them to a concrete set of rendering techniques when first drawn.

            An effect takes zero or more input images, and has an output image. The images that are input into and output from an effect are lazily evaluated.

            Creates Direct2D resources.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            The <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Factory"/> interface is the starting point for using Direct2D; it's what you use to create other Direct2D resources that you can use to draw or describe shapes.A factory defines a set of CreateResource methods that can produce the following drawing resources:Render targets: objects that render drawing commands. Drawing state blocks: objects that store drawing state information, such as the current transformation and antialiasing mode. Geometries: objects that represent simple and potentially complex shapes.To create an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Factory"/>, you use one of the CreateFactory methods. You should retain the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Factory"/> instance for as long as you use Direct2D resources; in general, you shouldn't need to recreate it when the application is running. For more information about Direct2D resources, see the Resources Overview.Singlethreaded and Multithreaded FactoriesWhen you create a factory, you can specify whether it is multithreaded or singlethreaded. A singlethreaded factory provides no serialization against any other single threaded instance within Direct2D, so, this mechanism provides a very large degree of scaling on the CPU.You can also create a multithreaded factory instance. In this case, the factory and all derived objects can be used from any thread and each render target can be rendered to independently. Direct2D serializes calls to these objects, so a single multithreaded Direct2D instance won't scale as well on the CPU as many single threaded instances. However, the resources can be shared within the multithreaded instance.Note that the qualifier "On the CPU": GPUs generally take advantage of fine-grained parallelism more so than CPUs. For example, multithreaded calls from the CPU might still end up being serialized when being sent to the GPU, however, a whole bank of pixel and vertex shaders will run in parallel to perform the rendering.

            <remarks>	
            To write to a Direct3D surface, you obtain an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> and pass it to the CreateDxgiSurfaceRenderTarget method to create a DXGI surface render target; you can then use the DXGI surface render target to draw 2-D content to the DXGI surface.A DXGI surface render target is a type of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget"/>. Like other Direct2D render targets, you can use it to create resources and issue drawing commands.The DXGI surface render target and the DXGI surface must use the same DXGI format. If you specify the DXGI_FORMAT_UNKOWN format when you create the render target, it will automatically use the surface's format.The DXGI surface render target does not perform DXGI surface synchronization.For more information about creating and using DXGI surface render targets, see the Direct2D and Direct3D Interoperability Overview.To work with Direct2D, the Direct3D device that provides the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> must be created with the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.DeviceCreationFlags.BgraSupport"/> flag.When you create a render target and hardware acceleration is available, you allocate resources on the computer's GPU. By creating a render target once and retaining it as long as possible, you gain performance benefits. Your application should create render targets once and hold onto them for the life of the application or until the render target's EndDraw method returns the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.ResultCode.RecreateTarget"/> error. When you receive this error, you need to recreate the render target (and any resources it created).

            <remarks>	
            Direct2D effects must define their properties at registration time via registration XML. An effect declares several required system properties, and can also declare custom properties. See Custom Effect Creation and Registration for more information about formatting the propertyXml parameter.RegisterEffect is both atomic and reference counted. To unregister an effect, call UnregisterEffect with the  classId of the effect.Important??RegisterEffect does not hold a reference to the DLL or executable file in which the effect is contained. The application must independently  make sure that the lifetime of the DLL or executable file completely contains all instances of each registered and created effect.Aside from the built-in effects that are globally registered, this API registers effects only for this factory, derived device, and device context interfaces.

            <remarks>	
            The CreateSharedBitmap method is useful for efficiently reusing bitmap data and can also be used to provide interoperability with Direct3D.Sharing an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/>By passing an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/> created by a render target that is resource-compatible, you can share a bitmap with that render target; both the original <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/> and the new <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/> created by this method will point to the same bitmap data. For more information about when render target resources can be shared, see the Sharing Render Target Resources section of the Resources Overview.You may also use this method to reinterpret the data of an existing bitmap and specify a new DPI or alpha mode. For example, in the case of a bitmap atlas, an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/> may contain multiple sub-images, each of which should be rendered with a different <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode"/> (<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Premultiplied"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Ignore"/>). You could use the CreateSharedBitmap method to reinterpret the bitmap using the desired alpha mode  without having to load a separate copy of the bitmap into memory.Sharing an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/>When using a DXGI surface render target (an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget"/> object created by the CreateDxgiSurfaceRenderTarget method), you can pass an  <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> surface to the CreateSharedBitmap method to share video memory with Direct3D and manipulate Direct3D content as an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/>. As described in  the Resources Overview, the render target and the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> must be using the same Direct3D device.Note also that the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> must use one of the supported pixel formats and alpha modes described in Supported Pixel Formats and Alpha Modes.For more information about interoperability with Direct3D, see the Direct2D and Direct3D Interoperability Overview.Sharing an <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapLock"/>An <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapLock"/> stores the content of a WIC bitmap and shields it from simultaneous accesses. By passing an <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapLock"/> to the CreateSharedBitmap method, you can create an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap"/> that points to the bitmap data already stored in the  <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapLock"/>.To use an <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapLock"/> with the CreateSharedBitmap method, the render target must use software rendering. To force a render target to use software rendering, set to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetType.Software"/> the type field of the  <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetProperties"/> structure that you use to create the render target. To check whether an existing render target uses software rendering, use the IsSupported method.

            <remarks>	
            The PushLayer method allows a caller to begin redirecting rendering to a layer. All rendering operations are valid in a layer. The location of the layer is affected by the world transform set on the render target.Each PushLayer must have a matching PopLayer call. If there are more PopLayer calls than PushLayer calls, the render target is placed into an error state. If Flush is called before all outstanding layers are popped, the render target is placed into an error state, and an error is returned. The error state can be cleared by a call to EndDraw.A particular <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Layer"/> resource can be active only at one time. In other words, you cannot call a PushLayer method, and then immediately follow  with another PushLayer method with the same layer resource. Instead, you must call the second PushLayer method with different layer resources.This method doesn't return an error code if it fails. To determine whether a drawing operation (such as PushLayer) failed, check the result returned by the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.EndDraw(System.Int64@,System.Int64@)"/> or <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.Flush(System.Int64@,System.Int64@)"/> methods.

             <para></para>Note??If rendering operations fail or if PopAxisAlignedClip is not called, clip rects may cause some artifacts on the render target. PopAxisAlignedClip can be considered a drawing operation that is designed to fix the borders of a clipping region. Without this call, the borders of a clipped area may be not antialiased or otherwise corrected.The PushAxisAlignedClip and PopAxisAlignedClip must match. Otherwise, the error state is set. For the render target to continue receiving new commands, you can call Flush to clear the error.A           PushAxisAlignedClip and PopAxisAlignedClip pair can occur around or within a PushLayer and PopLayer, but cannot overlap.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            To write to a Direct3D surface, you obtain an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> and pass it to the {{CreateDxgiSurfaceRenderTarget}} method to create a DXGI surface render target; you can then use the DXGI surface render target to draw 2-D content to the DXGI surface.  A DXGI surface render target is a type of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget"/>. Like other Direct2D render targets, you can use it to create resources and issue drawing commands. The DXGI surface render target and the DXGI surface must use the same DXGI format. If you specify the {{DXGI_FORMAT_UNKOWN}} format when you create the render target, it will automatically use the surface's format.The DXGI surface render target does not perform DXGI surface synchronization. To work with Direct2D, the Direct3D device that provides the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> must be created with the D3D10_CREATE_DEVICE_BGRA_SUPPORT flag.For more information about creating and using DXGI surface render targets, see the {{Direct2D and Direct3D Interoperability Overview}}.When you create a render target and hardware acceleration is available, you allocate resources on the computer's GPU. By creating a render target once and retaining it as long as possible, you gain performance benefits. Your application should create render targets once and hold onto them for the life of the application or until the render target's {{EndDraw}} method returns the {{D2DERR_RECREATE_TARGET}} error. When you receive this error, you need to recreate the render target (and any resources it created).

            <remarks>	
            Drawing operations can only be issued between a {{BeginDraw}} and EndDraw call.BeginDraw and EndDraw are use to indicate that a render target is in use by the Direct2D system. Different implementations of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget"/> might behave differently when {{BeginDraw}} is called. An <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapRenderTarget"/> may be locked between BeginDraw/EndDraw calls, a DXGI surface render target might be acquired on BeginDraw and released on EndDraw, while an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.WindowRenderTarget"/> may begin batching at BeginDraw and may present on EndDraw, for example. The BeginDraw method must be called before rendering operations can be called, though state-setting and state-retrieval operations can be performed even outside of {{BeginDraw}}/EndDraw. After {{BeginDraw}} is called, a render target will normally build up a batch of rendering commands, but defer processing of these commands until either an internal buffer is full, the {{Flush}} method is called, or until EndDraw is called. The EndDraw method causes any batched drawing operations to complete, and then returns an HRESULT indicating the success of the operations and, optionally, the tag state of the render target at the time the error occurred. The EndDraw method always succeeds: it should not be called twice even if a previous EndDraw resulted in a failing HRESULT. If EndDraw is called without a matched call to {{BeginDraw}}, it returns an error indicating that BeginDraw must be called before EndDraw. Calling BeginDraw twice on a render target puts the target into an error state where nothing further is drawn, and returns an appropriate HRESULT and error information when EndDraw is called.	
            </remarks>	
            <returns>If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code and sets tag1 and tag2 to the tags that were active when the error occurred. </returns>

            This method specifies the mapping from pixel space to device-independent space  for the render target.  If both dpiX and dpiY are 0, the factory-read system DPI is chosen. If one parameter is zero and the other unspecified, the DPI is not changed. For <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.WindowRenderTarget"/>, the DPI defaults to the most recently factory-read system DPI. The default value for all other render targets is 96 DPI.

            If the bitmap properties are not specified, the following information is assumed:The bitmap DPI is 96. The pixel format matches that of the surface. The returned bitmap will inherit the bind flags of the DXGI surface. However, only the subset of flags meaningful to Direct2D will be inherited. For example, <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.ResourceUsage.Dynamic"/> is not compatible with any public Direct2D flags.   The color context is unknown.If the bitmap properties are specified, the bitmap properties will be used as follows:The bitmap DPI will be specified by the bitmap properties. If both dpiX and dpiY are 0, the bitmap DPI will be 96. The pixel format must be a compatible shader or render target view of the surface. The bitmap options must be compatible with the bind flags of the DXGI surface. However, they may be a subset. This will influence what resource views are created by the bitmap. The color context information will be used from the bitmap properties, if specified.

They do not reflect the current clip rectangle set on the device context or the extent of the context?s current target image.

            If a target is not associated with the device context, target will contain <c>null</c> when the methods returns.If the currently selected target is a bitmap rather than a command list, the application can gain access to the initial bitmaps created by using one of the following methods:CreateHwndRenderTarget   CreateDxgiSurfaceRenderTarget   CreateWicBitmapRenderTarget   CreateDCRenderTarget   CreateCompatibleRenderTargetIt is not possible for an application to destroy these bitmaps.  All of these bitmaps are bindable as bitmap targets.  However not all of these bitmaps can be used as bitmap sources for  <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget"/> methods.CreateDxgiSurfaceRenderTarget will create a bitmap that is usable as a bitmap source if the DXGI surface is bindable as a shader resource view.CreateCompatibleRenderTarget will always create bitmaps that are usable as a bitmap source.<see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.BeginDraw"/> will copy from the <see cref="T:System.IntPtr"/> to the original bitmap associated with it.  <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.EndDraw(System.Int64@,System.Int64@)"/> will copy from the original bitmap to the <see cref="T:System.IntPtr"/>.<see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.Bitmap"/> objects will be locked in the following circumstances:BeginDraw has been called and the currently selected target bitmap is a WIC bitmap. A WIC bitmap is set as the target of a device context after BeginDraw has been called and before EndDraw has been called. Any of the ID2D1Bitmap::Copy* methods are called with a WIC bitmap as either the source or destination.IWICBitmap objects will be unlocked in the following circumstances:EndDraw is called and the currently selected target bitmap is a WIC bitmap. A WIC bitmap is removed as the target of a device context between the calls to BeginDraw and EndDraw. Any of the ID2D1Bitmap::Copy* methods are called with a WIC bitmap as either the source or destination.Direct2D will only lock bitmaps that are not currently locked.Calling QueryInterface for <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GdiInteropRenderTarget"/> will always succeed.  <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GdiInteropRenderTarget.GetDC(SharpDX.Direct2D1.DeviceContextInitializeMode)"/> will return a device context corresponding to the currently bound target bitmap.  GetDC will fail if the target bitmap was not created with the GDI_COMPATIBLE flag set.<see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.WindowRenderTarget.Resize(SharpDX.DrawingSize)"/> will return <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.ResultCode.InvalidCall"/> if there are any outstanding references to the original target bitmap associated with the render target.Although the target can be a command list, it cannot be any other type of image. It cannot be the output image of an effect.

If compositeMode is not D2D1_COMPOSITE_MODE_DEFAULT, the image will be extended to transparent up to the current axis-aligned clip.If there is an image rectangle and a world transform, this is equivalent to inserting a clip effect to represent the image rectangle and a 2D affine transform to take into account the world transform.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            If a target is not associated with the device context, target will contain <c>null</c> when the methods returns.If the currently selected target is a bitmap rather than a command list, the application can gain access to the initial bitmaps created by using one of the following methods:CreateHwndRenderTarget   CreateDxgiSurfaceRenderTarget   CreateWicBitmapRenderTarget   CreateDCRenderTarget   CreateCompatibleRenderTargetIt is not possible for an application to destroy these bitmaps.  All of these bitmaps are bindable as bitmap targets.  However not all of these bitmaps can be used as bitmap sources for  <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget"/> methods.CreateDxgiSurfaceRenderTarget will create a bitmap that is usable as a bitmap source if the DXGI surface is bindable as a shader resource view.CreateCompatibleRenderTarget will always create bitmaps that are usable as a bitmap source.<see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.BeginDraw"/> will copy from the <see cref="T:System.IntPtr"/> to the original bitmap associated with it.  <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.EndDraw(System.Int64@,System.Int64@)"/> will copy from the original bitmap to the <see cref="T:System.IntPtr"/>.<see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.Bitmap"/> objects will be locked in the following circumstances:BeginDraw has been called and the currently selected target bitmap is a WIC bitmap. A WIC bitmap is set as the target of a device context after BeginDraw has been called and before EndDraw has been called. Any of the ID2D1Bitmap::Copy* methods are called with a WIC bitmap as either the source or destination.IWICBitmap objects will be unlocked in the following circumstances:EndDraw is called and the currently selected target bitmap is a WIC bitmap. A WIC bitmap is removed as the target of a device context between the calls to BeginDraw and EndDraw. Any of the ID2D1Bitmap::Copy* methods are called with a WIC bitmap as either the source or destination.Direct2D will only lock bitmaps that are not currently locked.Calling QueryInterface for <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GdiInteropRenderTarget"/> will always succeed.  <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GdiInteropRenderTarget.GetDC(SharpDX.Direct2D1.DeviceContextInitializeMode)"/> will return a device context corresponding to the currently bound target bitmap.  GetDC will fail if the target bitmap was not created with the GDI_COMPATIBLE flag set.<see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.WindowRenderTarget.Resize(SharpDX.DrawingSize)"/> will return <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.ResultCode.InvalidCall"/> if there are any outstanding references to the original target bitmap associated with the render target.Although the target can be a command list, it cannot be any other type of image. It cannot be the output image of an effect.

            <remarks>	
            IWICBitmap inherits from <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapSource"/> and therefore also inherits the CopyPixels method. When pixels need to be moved to a new memory location, CopyPixels is often the most efficient.Because of to the internal memory representation implied by the <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.Bitmap"/>, in-place modification and processing using the Lock is more efficient than CopyPixels, usually reducing to a simple reference access directly into the memory owned by the bitmap rather than a as a copy.  This is contrasted to procedural bitmaps which implement only CopyPixels because there is no internal memory representation and one would need to be created on demand to satisfy a call to Lock.

            This interface provides a common way of accessing and linking together bitmaps, decoders, format converters, and scalers. Components that implement this interface can be connected together in a graph to pull imaging data through.This interface defines only the notion of readability or being able to produce pixels. Modifying or writing to a bitmap is considered to be a specialization specific to bitmaps which have storage and is defined in the descendant interface <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.Bitmap"/>.

            Some formats, such as GIF and ICO, do not have full DPI support. For GIF, this method calculates the DPI values from the aspect ratio, using a base DPI of (96.0, 96.0). The ICO format does not support DPI at all, and the method always returns (96.0,96.0) for ICO images.Additionally, WIC itself does not transform images based on the DPI values in an image. It is up to the caller to transform an image based on the resolution returned.

            <remarks>	
            CopyPixels is one of the two main image processing routines (the other being Lock) triggering the actual processing.  It instructs the object to produce pixels according to its algorithm - this may involve decoding a portion of a JPEG stored on disk, copying a block of memory, or even analytically computing a complex gradient.  The algorithm is completely dependent on the object implementing the interface.The caller can restrict the operation to a rectangle of interest (ROI) using the prc parameter.  The ROI sub-rectangle must be fully contained in the bounds of the bitmap.  Specifying a <c>null</c> ROI implies that the whole bitmap should be returned.The caller controls the memory management and must provide an output buffer (pbBuffer) for the results of the copy along with the buffer's bounds (cbBufferSize).  The cbStride parameter defines the count of bytes between two vertically adjacent pixels in the output buffer.  The caller must ensure that there is sufficient buffer to complete the call based on the width, height and pixel format of the bitmap and the sub-rectangle provided to the copy method.If the caller needs to perform numerous copies of an expensive <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapSource"/> such as a JPEG, it is recommended to create an in-memory <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.Bitmap"/> first.Codec Developer RemarksThe callee must only write to the first (prc-&gt;Width*bitsperpixel+7)/8 bytes of each line of the output buffer (in this case, a line is a consecutive string of cbStride bytes).

            This method has no effect on the actual pixels or samples stored in the bitmap.  Instead the interpretation of the sampling rate is modified.  This means that a 96 DPI image which is 96 pixels wide is one inch.  If the physical resolution is modified to 48 DPI, then the bitmap is considered to be 2 inches wide but has the same number of pixels.   If the resolution is less than REAL_EPSILON (1.192092896e-07F) the error code WINCODEC_ERR_INVALIDPARAMETER is returned.

            The usage pattern for this method is a two call process. The first call retrieves the array size needed to retrieve all the supported pixel formats by calling it with cFormats set to 0 and pguidPixelFormats set to <c>null</c>. This call sets pcActual to the array size needed. Once the needed array size is determined, a second GetPixelFormats call with pguidPixelFormats set to an array of the appropriate size will retrieve the pixel formats.

            Applications can only register a single callback. Subsequent registration calls will replace the previously registered callback. To unregister a callback, pass in <c>null</c> or register a new callback function.Progress is reported in an increasing order between 0.0 and 1.0.  If dwProgressFlags includes <see cref="F:SharpDX.WIC.ProgressNotification.Begin"/>, the callback is guaranteed to be called with progress 0.0. If dwProgressFlags includes <see cref="F:SharpDX.WIC.ProgressNotification.End"/>, the callback is guaranteed to be called with progress 1.0.WICProgressNotificationFrequent increases the frequency in which the callback is called. If an operation is expected to take more than 30 seconds, <see cref="F:SharpDX.WIC.ProgressNotification.Frequent"/> should be added to dwProgressFlags.

            The parameter ppIEncoderOptions can be used to receive an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Win32.PropertyBag"/> that can then be used to specify encoder options. This is done by passing a reference to a NULLIPropertyBag2 reference in ppIEncoderOptions. You should then set your desired encoder options on the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Win32.PropertyBag"/> returned, and pass this <see cref="T:SharpDX.Win32.PropertyBag"/> to <see cref="M:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapFrameEncode.Initialize(SharpDX.Win32.PropertyBag)"/>.Note??Do not pass in a reference to an initialized <see cref="T:SharpDX.Win32.PropertyBag"/>. The reference will be overwritten, and the original <see cref="T:SharpDX.Win32.PropertyBag"/> will not be freed.Otherwise, you can pass <c>null</c> in ppIEncoderOptions if you do not intend to specify encoder options.See Encoding Overview for an example of how to set encoder options.

            <summary>	
            Exposes methods that produce a flipped (horizontal or vertical) and/or rotated (by 90 degree increments) bitmap source. Rotations are done before the flip.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            IWICBitmapFipRotator requests data on a per-pixel basis, while WIC codecs provide data on a per-scanline basis. This causes the fliprotator object to exhibit n2 behavior if there is no buffering.  This occures because each pixel in the transformed image requires an entire scanline to be decoded in the file. It is recommended that you buffer the image using <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.Bitmap"/>, or flip/rotate the image using Direct2D.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            Images can be scaled to larger sizes; however, even with sophisticated scaling algorithms, there is only so much information in the image and artifacts tend to worsen the more you scale up.The scaler will reapply the resampling algorithm every time CopyPixels is called.  If the scaled image is to be animated, the scaled image should be created once and cached in a new bitmap, after which the <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapScaler"/> may be released.  In this way the scaling algorithm - which may be computationally expensive relative to drawing - is performed only once and the result displayed many times.The scaler is optimized to use the minimum amount of memory required to scale the image correctly.  The scaler may be used to produce parts of the image incrementally (banding) by calling CopyPixels with different rectangles representing the output bands of the image.  Resampling typically requires overlapping rectangles from the source image and thus may need to request the same pixels from the source bitmap multiple times.  Requesting scanlines out-of-order from some image decoders can have a significant performance penalty.  Because of this reason, the scaler is optimized to handle consecutive horizontal bands of scanlines (rectangle width equal to the bitmap width).  In this case the accumulator from the previous vertically adjacent rectangle is re-used to avoid duplicate scanline requests from the source.  This implies that banded output from the scaler may have better performance if the bands are requested sequentially.  Of course if the scaler is simply used to produce a single rectangle output, this concern is eliminated because the scaler will internally request scanlines in the correct order.

            <summary>	
            Though optional, we highly recommend that every decoder implement this interface on your frame-level decoding class, because it can provide major performance benefits.  When an application requests a specific region of interest, size, orientation, or pixel format, instead of just decoding the whole image at full resolution and then applying the requested transforms, Windows Imaging Component (WIC) calls IUnknown::QueryInterface for this interface on the <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapFrameDecode"/> object.  If the frame decoder supports it, WIC calls the appropriate method or methods to determine whether the frame decoder can perform the requested transform or determine the closest size or pixel format the decoder can provide to the one requested.  If the decoder can perform the requested transform or transforms, WIC invokes CopyPixels with the appropriate parameters.  If the decoder can perform some, but not all of the requested transforms, WIC asks the decoder to perform those that it can, and uses the WIC transform objects (<see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapScaler"/>, <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapClipper"/>, <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapFlipRotator"/>, and <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.FormatConverter"/>) to perform the remaining transforms that could not be performed by the frame decoder on the result of the CopyPixels call.  If the decoder doesn't support <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapSourceTransform"/>, then WIC must use the transform objects to perform all of the transforms. It's usually much more efficient for the decoder to perform transforms during the decoding process than it is to decode the entire image and then perform the transforms. This is especially true for operations such as scaling to a much smaller size or pixel format conversions.

            Codec Developer RemarksFor codec developer implementation details for this method, see Implementing <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapSourceTransform"/>.When multiple transform operations are requested, the result is dependent on the order in which the operations are performed. To ensure predictability and consistency across CODECs, it's important that all CODECs perform these operations in the same order. The recommended order of these operations is:Scale Crop Flip/RotatePixel format conversion can be performed at any time, since it has no effect on the other transforms.The first parameter, prc is used to specify the region of interest for clipping the image. By convention, scaling is performed before clipping so, if the image is to be scaled as well as clipped, the region of interest should be determined after the image has been scaled.If a dstTransform is specified, the stride is the transformed stride, and is based on the pixelFormat specified in the CopyPixels call, not the original frame's pixel format.

            <remarks>	
            Codec implementers should faithfully adjust the color temperature within the range supported natively by the raw image. For values outside the native support range, the codec implementer should provide a best effort representation of the image at that color temperature.Codec implementers should return WINCODEC_ERR_VALUEOUTOFRANGE if the value is out of defined acceptable range.Codec implementers must ensure proper interoperability with other white point setting methods such as SetWhitePointRGB. For example, if the caller sets the white point via SetNamedWhitePoint then the codec implementer may want to disable reading back the correspoinding Kelvin temperature. In specific cases where the codec implementer wants to deny a given action because of previous calls, WINCODEC_ERR_WRONGSTATE should be returned.

            <remarks>	
            If you do not have a predefined palette, you must first create one. Use InitializeFromBitmap to create the palette object, then pass it in along with your other parameters.dither, pIPalette, alphaThresholdPercent, and paletteTranslate are used to mitigate color loss when converting to a reduced bit-depth format. For conversions that do not need these settings, the following parameters values should be used: dither set to <see cref="F:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapDitherType.None"/>, pIPalette set to <c>null</c>, alphaThresholdPercent set to 0.0f, and paletteTranslate set to <see cref="F:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapPaletteType.Custom"/>.The basic algorithm involved when using an ordered dither requires a fixed palette, found in the <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapPaletteType"/> enumeration, in a specific order. Often, the actual palette provided for the output may have a different ordering or some slight variation in the actual colors.  This is the case when using the Microsoft?Windows palette which has slight differences among versions of Windows. To provide for this, a palette and a palette translation are given to the format converter.  The pIPalette is the actual destination palette to be used and the paletteTranslate is a fixed palette.  Once the conversion is complete, the colors are mapped from the fixed palette to the actual colors in pIPalette using a nearest color matching algorithm.If colors in pIPalette do not closely match those in paletteTranslate, the mapping may produce undesireable results.WICBitmapDitherTypeOrdered4x4 can be useful in format conversions from 8-bit formats to 5- or 6-bit formats as there is no way to accurately convert color data.WICBitmapDitherTypeErrorDiffusion selects the error diffusion algorithm and may be used with any palette.  If an arbitrary palette is provided, WICBitmapPaletteCustom should be passed in as the paletteTranslate.  Error diffusion often provides superior results compared to the ordered dithering algorithms especially when combined with the optimized palette generation functionality on the <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.Palette"/>.When converting a bitmap which has an alpha channel, such as a Portable Network Graphics (PNG), to 8bpp, the alpha channel is normally ignored.  Any pixels which were transparent in the original bitmap show up as black in the final output because both transparent and black have pixel values of zero in the respective formats.Some 8bpp content can contains an alpha color; for instance, the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) format allows for a single palette entry to be used as a transparent color. For this type of content, alphaThresholdPercent specifies what percentage of transparency should map to the transparent color. Because the alpha value is directly proportional to the opacity (not transparency) of a pixel, the alphaThresholdPercent indicates what level of opacity is mapped to the fully transparent color.  For instance, 9.8% implies that any pixel with an alpha value of less than 25 will be mapped to the transparent color.  A value of 100% maps all pixels which are not fully opaque to the transparent color. Note that the palette should provide a transparent color. If it does not, the 'transparent' color will be the one closest to zero - often black.

            The format converter does not necessarily guarantee symmetricality with respect to conversion; that is, a converter may be able to convert FROM a particular format without actually being able to convert TO a particular format.

The converter will fill pcActual with the number of formats supported by that converter.

            If the <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.BitmapPaletteType"/> is not WICBitmapPaletteCustom, then the colors are automatically generated based on the table above.  If the user subsequently changes a color palette entry the WICBitmapPalette is set to Custom by that action.InitializeFromBitmap's fAddTransparentColor parameter will add a transparent color to the end of the color collection if its size if less than 256, otherwise index 255 will be replaced with the transparent color.  If a pre-defined palette type is used, it will change to BitmapPaletteTypeCustom since it no longer matches the predefined palette.The palette interface is an auxiliary imaging interface in that it does not directly concern bitmaps and pixels; rather it provides indexed color translation for indexed bitmaps. For an indexed pixel format with M bits per pixels: (The number of colors in the palette) greater than 2^M.Traditionally the basic operation of the palette is to provide a translation from a byte (or smaller) index into a 32bpp color value. This is often accomplished by a 256 entry table of color values.

            <remarks>	
            The resulting palette contains the specified number of colors which best represent the colors present in the bitmap. The algorithm operates on the opaque RGB color value of each pixel in the reference bitmap and hence ignores any alpha values. If a transparent color is required, set the fAddTransparentColor parameter to TRUE and one fewer optimized color will be computed, reducing the colorCount, and a fully transparent color entry will be added.

            Decoders and metadata handlers are expected to create sub streams of whatever stream they hold when handing off control for embedded metadata to another metadata handler.  If the stream is not restricted then use MAXLONGLONG as the max size and offset 0.The <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.WICStream"/> interface methods do not enable you to provide a file sharing option. To create a file stream for an image, use the SHCreateStreamOnFileEx function.

            <remarks>	
            This method should be avoided whenever possible. The caller is responsible for ensuring the memory block is valid for the lifetime of the stream when using InitializeFromMemory.  A workaround for this behavior is to create an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Win32.IStream"/> and use InitializeFromIStream to create the <see cref="T:SharpDX.WIC.WICStream"/>.If you require a growable memory stream, use CreateStreamOnHGlobal.

            The stream functions with its own stream position, independent of the underlying stream but restricted to a region.  All seek positions are relative to the sub region.  It is allowed, though not recommended, to have multiple writable sub streams overlapping the same range.

            The top left corner of the sourceRectangle parameter maps to the brush space origin. That is, if the  brush and world transforms are both identity, the portion of the image in the top left corner of the source rectangle will be rendered at (0,0) in the render target.The source rectangle will be expanded differently depending on whether the input image is based on   pixels (a bitmap or effect) or by a command list.If the input image is a bitmap or an effect, the rectangle will be expanded to encapsulate a full input pixel before being additionally down-scaled to ensure that the projected rectangle will be correct in the final scene-space. If the input image is a command list, the command list will be slightly expanded to encapsulate a full input pixel.

            Represents a geometry resource and defines a set of helper methods for manipulating and measuring geometric shapes.  Interfaces that inherit from <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Geometry"/> define specific shapes.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            There are several types of Direct2D geometry objects:  a  simple geometry (<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RectangleGeometry"/>, <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RoundedRectangleGeometry"/>, or <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.EllipseGeometry"/>), a path geometry (<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.PathGeometry"/>), or a composite geometry (<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GeometryGroup"/> and <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.TransformedGeometry"/>).Direct2D geometries enable you to  describe two-dimensional figures and also offer  many uses, such as defining  hit-test regions,  clip regions, and even   animation paths.Direct2D geometries are immutable and device-independent resources created by <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Factory"/>.  In general, you should create geometries once and retain them for the life of the application, or until they need to be modified. For more information about device-independent and device-dependent resources, see  the Resources Overview.

            <remarks>	
            The Outline method allows the caller to produce a geometry with an equivalent fill to the input geometry, with the following additional properties:The output geometry contains no transverse intersections; that is, segments may touch, but they never cross. The outermost figures in the output geometry are all oriented counterclockwise.  The output geometry is fill-mode invariant; that is, the fill of the geometry does not depend on the choice of the fill mode. For more information about the fill mode, see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.FillMode"/>.Additionally, the  Outline method can be useful in removing redundant portions of said geometries to simplify complex geometries. It can also be useful in combination with <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GeometryGroup"/> to create unions among several geometries simultaneously.

For more information about the fill mode, see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.FillMode"/>.Additionally, the  {{Outline}} method can be useful in removing redundant portions of said geometries to simplify complex geometries. It can also be useful in combination with <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GeometryGroup"/> to create unions among several geometries simultaneously.

            <remarks>	
            Because path geometries are immutable and can only be populated once, it is an error to call Open on a path geometry more than once.Note that the fill mode defaults to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.FillMode.Alternate"/>. To set the fill mode, call SetFillMode before the first call to BeginFigure. Failure to do so will put the geometry sink in an error state.

Note that font file loader implementations must not register themselves with DirectWrite inside their constructors and must not unregister themselves in their destructors, because registration and unregistraton operations increment and decrement the object reference count respectively. Instead, registration and unregistration of font file loaders with DirectWrite should be performed outside of the font file loader implementation.

These interfaces use the system font collection by default, but can use a custom font collection instead.To determine what fonts are available on the system,  get a reference to the system font collection.  You can then use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DirectWrite.FontCollection.GetFontFamilyCount"/> method to determine the number of fonts and loop through the list.

            The font collection loader interface is recommended to be implemented by a singleton object. Note that font collection loader implementations must not register themselves with DirectWrite factory inside their constructors and must not unregister themselves in their destructors, because registration and unregistraton operations increment and decrement the object reference count respectively. Instead, registration and unregistration of font file loaders with DirectWrite factory should be performed outside of the font file loader implementation as a separate step.

            Note that this mapping is primarily provided for line layout engines built on top of the physical font API. Because of OpenType glyph substitution and line layout character substitution, the nominal conversion does not always correspond to how a Unicode string will map to glyph indices when rendering using a particular font face. Also, note that Unicode variant selectors provide for alternate mappings for character to glyph. This call will always return the default variant.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            A non-zero value generally enables the feature execution, while the zero value disables it. A feature requiring a selector uses this value to indicate the selector index.The OpenType standard provides access to typographic features available in the font by means of a feature tag with the associated parameters. The OpenType feature tag is a 4-byte identifier of the registered name of a feature. For example, the 'kern' feature name tag is used to identify the 'Kerning' feature in OpenType font. Similarly, the OpenType feature tag for 'Standard Ligatures' and 'Fractions' is 'liga' and 'frac' respectively. Since a single run can be associated with more than one typographic features, the Text String API accepts typographic settings for a run as a list of features and are executed in the order they are specified.The value of the tag member represents the OpenType name tag of the feature, while the param value represents additional parameter for the execution of the feature referred by the tag member. Both nameTag and parameter are stored as little endian, the same convention followed by GDI.  Most features treat the Param value as a binary value that indicates whether to turn the execution of the feature on or off, with it being off by default in the majority of cases. Some features, however, treat this value as an integral value representing the integer index to the list of alternate results it may produce during the execution; for instance, the feature 'Stylistic Alternates' or 'salt' uses the parameter value as an index to the list of alternate substituting glyphs it could produce for a specified glyph.

            The font file loader interface is recommended to be implemented by a singleton object.

            Implementing GetFileSize() for asynchronously loaded font files may require downloading the complete file contents. Therefore, this method should be used only for operations that either require a complete font file to be loaded (for example, copying a font file) or that need to make decisions based on the value of the file size (for example, validation against a persisted file size).

            The alpha texture can be a   bi-level alpha  texture or a ClearType alpha texture.A bi-level alpha texture contains one byte per pixel, therefore the size of the buffer for a bi-level texture will be the area of the texture bounds, in bytes. Each byte in a bi-level alpha texture created by CreateAlphaTexture is either set to DWRITE_ALPHA_MAX (that is, 255) or zero.A ClearType alpha texture contains three bytes per pixel, therefore the size of the buffer for a ClearType alpha texture is three times the area of the texture bounds, in bytes.

            <remarks>	
            The set of strings represented by an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.LocalizedStrings"/> are indexed by a zero based UINT32 number that maps to a locale.  The numeric index for a specific locale is retreived by using the FindLocaleName method.A common use for the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.LocalizedStrings"/> interface is to hold a list of localized font family names created by using the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DirectWrite.FontFamily.GetFamilyNames(SharpDX.DirectWrite.LocalizedStrings@)"/> method.  The following example shows how to get the family name for the "en-us" locale.<code>	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.LocalizedStrings"/>* pFamilyNames = <c>null</c>; // Get a list of localized strings for the family name.	
            if (SUCCEEDED(hr))	
            { hr = pFontFamily-&gt;GetFamilyNames(&amp;pFamilyNames);	
            } UINT32 index = 0;	
            <see cref="T:System.Boolean"/> exists = false; wchar_t localeName[LOCALE_NAME_MAX_LENGTH]; if (SUCCEEDED(hr))	
            { // Get the default locale for this user. int defaultLocaleSuccess = GetUserDefaultLocaleName(localeName, LOCALE_NAME_MAX_LENGTH); // If the default locale is returned, find that locale name, otherwise use "en-us". if (defaultLocaleSuccess) { hr = pFamilyNames-&gt;FindLocaleName(localeName, &amp;index, &amp;exists); } if (SUCCEEDED(hr) &amp;&amp; !exists) // if the above find did not find a match, retry with US English { hr = pFamilyNames-&gt;FindLocaleName(L"en-us", &amp;index, &amp;exists); }	
            } // If the specified locale doesn't exist, select the first on the list.	
            if (!exists) index = 0; UINT32 length = 0; // Get the string length.	
            if (SUCCEEDED(hr))	
            { hr = pFamilyNames-&gt;GetStringLength(index, &amp;length);	
            } // Allocate a string big enough to hold the name.	
            wchar_t* name = new (std::nothrow) wchar_t[length+1];

            Note that the mapping from characters to glyphs is, in general, many-to-many.  The recommended estimate for the per-glyph output buffers is (3 * textLength / 2 + 16).  This is not guaranteed to be sufficient. The value of the actualGlyphCount parameter is only valid if the call succeeds.  In the event that maxGlyphCount is not big enough, HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(<see cref="F:SharpDX.Win32.ErrorCode.InsufficientBuffer"/>) will be returned.  The application should  allocate a larger buffer and try again.

            </code>When creating an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextFormat"/> object using the CreateTextFormat function, the application specifies the  font family, font collection, font weight, font size, and locale name for the text format.These properties cannot be changed after the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextFormat"/> object is created.  To change these properties, a new <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextFormat"/> object must be created with the desired properties.The <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextFormat"/> interface is used to draw text with a single formatTo draw text with multiple formats, or to use a custom text renderer, use the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextLayout"/> interface.  <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextLayout"/> enables the application to change the format for ranges of text within the string.

            The <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextLayout"/> interface represents a block of text after it has been fully analyzed and formatted.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            To get a reference to the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextLayout"/> interface, the application must call the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DirectWrite.Factory.CreateTextLayout(System.String,System.Int32,SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextFormat,System.Single,System.Single,SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextLayout)"/> method, as shown in the following code.<code>	
             // Create a text layout using the text format.	
            if (SUCCEEDED(hr))	
            { <see cref="T:SharpDX.Rectangle"/> rect; GetClientRect(hwnd_, &amp;rect);  float width  = rect.right  / dpiScaleX_; float height = rect.bottom / dpiScaleY_; hr = pDWriteFactory_-&gt;CreateTextLayout( wszText_,      // The string to be laid out and formatted. cTextLength_,  // The length of the string. pTextFormat_,  // The text format to apply to the string (contains font information, etc). width,         // The width of the layout box. height,        // The height of the layout box. &amp;pTextLayout_  // The <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextLayout"/> interface reference. );	
            } 	
            </code>The <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextLayout"/> interface allows the application to change the format for ranges of the text it represents, specified by a <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextRange"/> structure.   The following example shows how to set the font weight for a text range.<code>	
             // Set the font weight to bold for the first 5 letters.	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextRange"/> textRange = {0, 4}; if (SUCCEEDED(hr))	
            { hr = pTextLayout_-&gt;SetFontWeight(<see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectWrite.FontWeight.Bold"/>, textRange);	
            } 	
            </code>IDWriteTextLayout also provides methods for adding strikethrough,  underline, and inline objects to the text.To draw the block of text represented by an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextLayout"/> object, Direct2D provides the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.DrawTextLayout(SharpDX.DrawingPointF,SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextLayout,SharpDX.Direct2D1.Brush,SharpDX.Direct2D1.DrawTextOptions)"/> method. To draw using a custom renderer implement an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextRenderer"/> interface and  call the  <see cref="M:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextLayout.Draw_(System.IntPtr,System.IntPtr,System.Single,System.Single)"/> methodDirectWrite and Direct2DTo draw a formatted string represented by an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextLayout"/> object, Direct2D provides the  <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.DrawTextLayout(SharpDX.DrawingPointF,SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextLayout,SharpDX.Direct2D1.Brush,SharpDX.Direct2D1.DrawTextOptions)"/> method.Other Rendering OptionsTo render using a custom renderer, use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextLayout.Draw_(System.IntPtr,System.IntPtr,System.Single,System.Single)"/> method, which takes a callback interface derived from <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextRenderer"/> as an argument, as shown in the following code.<code>	
             // Draw the text layout using DirectWrite and the CustomTextRenderer class.	
            hr = pTextLayout_-&gt;Draw( <c>null</c>, pTextRenderer_,  // Custom text renderer. origin.x, origin.y ); 	
            </code><see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextRenderer"/> declares methods for drawing a glyph run, underline, strikethrough and inline objects.  It is up to the application to implement these methods.  Creating a custom text renderer allows the application to apply additional effects when rendering text, such as a custom fill or outline.Using a custom text renderer also enables you to render using another technology, such as GDI.

            <remarks>	
            To draw text with this method, a textLayout object needs to be created by the application using <see cref="M:SharpDX.DirectWrite.Factory.CreateTextLayout(System.String,System.Int32,SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextFormat,System.Single,System.Single,SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextLayout)"/>. After the textLayout object is obtained, the application calls the  IDWriteTextLayout::Draw method  to draw the text, decorations, and inline objects. The actual drawing is done through the callback interface passed in as the textRenderer argument; there, the corresponding DrawGlyphRun API is called.

            <summary>	
            The application calls this function to get a set of hit-test metrics corresponding to a range of text positions. 
            One of the main usages is to implement highlight selection of the text string. 
            The function returns E_NOT_SUFFICIENT_BUFFER, which is equivalent to HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER), 
            when the buffer size of hitTestMetrics is too small to hold all the regions calculated by the function. 
            In this situation, the function sets the output value *actualHitTestMetricsCount to the number of geometries calculated. 
            The application is responsible for allocating a new buffer of greater size and calling the function again. 
            A good value to use as an initial value for maxHitTestMetricsCount may be calculated from the following equation: 
            maxHitTestMetricsCount = lineCount * maxBidiReorderingDepth where lineCount is obtained from the value of the output argument *actualLineCount (from the function IDWriteTextLayout::GetLineLengths), and the maxBidiReorderingDepth value from the DWRITE_TEXT_METRICS structure of the output argument *textMetrics (from the function IDWriteFactory::CreateTextLayout).

            <summary>	
            The application calls this function to get a set of hit-test metrics corresponding to a range of text positions. One of the main usages is to implement highlight selection of the text string. The function returns E_NOT_SUFFICIENT_BUFFER, which is equivalent to HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(<see cref="F:SharpDX.Win32.ErrorCode.InsufficientBuffer"/>), when the buffer size of hitTestMetrics is too small to hold all the regions calculated by the function. In this situation, the function sets the output value *actualHitTestMetricsCount to the number of geometries calculated. The application is responsible for allocating a new buffer of greater size and calling the function again. A good value to use as an initial value for maxHitTestMetricsCount may be calculated from the following equation: maxHitTestMetricsCount = lineCount * maxBidiReorderingDepth where lineCount is obtained from the value of the output argument *actualLineCount (from the function IDWriteTextLayout::GetLineLengths), and the maxBidiReorderingDepth value from the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextMetrics"/> structure of the output argument *textMetrics (from the function <see cref="M:SharpDX.DirectWrite.Factory.CreateTextLayout(System.String,System.Int32,SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextFormat,System.Single,System.Single,SharpDX.DirectWrite.TextLayout)"/>).

             A single underline can be broken into multiple calls, depending on how the formatting changes attributes. If font sizes/styles change within an underline, the thickness and offset will be averaged weighted according to characters. To get an appropriate starting pixel position, add underline::offset to the baseline. Otherwise there will be no spacing between the text. The x coordinate will always be passed as the left side, regardless of text directionality. This simplifies drawing and reduces the problem of round-off that could potentially cause gaps or a double stamped alpha blend. To avoid alpha overlap, round the end points to the nearest device pixel.

            <remarks>	
            An <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapRenderTarget"/> writes to an intermediate texture. It's useful for creating patterns for use with an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapBrush"/> or caching drawing data that will be used repeatedly.To write directly to a WIC bitmap instead, use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Factory.CreateWicBitmapRenderTarget(SharpDX.WIC.Bitmap,SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetProperties@,SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget)"/> method. This method returns an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget"/> that writes to the specified WIC bitmap. For an example, see the Save as Image File Sample.Creating <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapRenderTarget"/> ObjectsTo create a bitmap render target, call the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.CreateCompatibleRenderTarget(System.Nullable{SharpDX.DrawingSizeF},System.Nullable{SharpDX.DrawingSize},System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct2D1.PixelFormat},SharpDX.Direct2D1.CompatibleRenderTargetOptions,SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapRenderTarget)"/> method.Like other render targets, an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapRenderTarget"/> is a device-dependent resource and must be recreated when the associated device becomes unavailable. For more information, see the Resources Overview.

            The pixel size and DPI of the new render target can be altered by specifying values for desiredSize or desiredPixelSize:  If desiredSize is specified but desiredPixelSize is not, the pixel size is computed from the desired size using the parent target DPI. If the desiredSize maps to a integer-pixel size, the DPI of the compatible render target is the same as the DPI of the parent target.  If desiredSize maps to a fractional-pixel size, the pixel size is rounded up to the nearest integer and the DPI for the compatible render target is slightly higher than the DPI of the parent render target. In all cases, the coordinate (desiredSize.width, desiredSize.height) maps to the lower-right corner of the compatible render target.If the desiredPixelSize is specified and desiredSize is not, the DPI of the new render target is the same as the original render target.If both desiredSize and desiredPixelSize are specified, the DPI of the new render target is computed to account for the difference in scale.If neither desiredSize nor desiredPixelSize is specified, the new render target size and DPI match the original render target.

             A single underline can be broken into multiple calls, depending on how the formatting changes attributes.

To get an appropriate starting pixel position, add underline::offset to the baseline. Otherwise there will be no spacing between the text. The x coordinate will always be passed as the left side, regardless of text directionality. This simplifies drawing and reduces the problem of round-off that could potentially cause gaps or a double stamped alpha blend. To avoid alpha overlap, round the end points to the nearest device pixel.

            <remarks>	
            You don't create an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GdiInteropRenderTarget"/> object directly; instead, you use the QueryInterface method of an existing render target instance to provide an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GdiInteropRenderTarget"/> version of that render target.Not all render targets support the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GdiInteropRenderTarget"/> interface. The render target must be GDI-compatible (the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetUsage.GdiCompatible"/> flag was specified when creating the render target), use the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm"/> pixel format, and use  the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Premultiplied"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Ignore"/> alpha mode.Note that the QueryInterface method always succeeds; if the render target doesn't support the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GdiInteropRenderTarget"/> interface, calling GetDC will fail. (For render targets created through the CreateCompatibleRenderTarget method, the render target that created it must have these settings.)To test whether a given render target supports the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GdiInteropRenderTarget"/> interface, create a <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetProperties"/> that specifies GDI compatibility and the appropriate pixel format, then call the render target's IsSupported method to see whether the render target is GDI-compatible.

            Specifies the type of DirectWrite factory object.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            A DirectWrite factory object contains information about its internal state, such as font loader registration and cached font data. In most cases you should use the shared factory object, because it allows multiple components that use DirectWrite to share internal DirectWrite state information, thereby reducing memory usage. However, there are cases when it is desirable to reduce the impact of a component on the rest of the process, such as a plug-in from an untrusted source,  by sandboxing and isolating it from the rest of the process components. In such cases, you should use an isolated factory for the sandboxed component.

            Represents the style of a font face as normal, italic, or oblique.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            Three terms categorize the slant of a font: normal, italic, and oblique.Font styleDescription NormalThe characters in a normal, or roman, font are upright. 	
             Italic 	
            The characters in an italic font are truly slanted and appear as they were designed. 	
             ObliqueThe characters in an oblique font are artificially slanted.?For Oblique, the slant is achieved by performing a shear transformation on the characters from a normal font. When a true italic font is not available on a computer or printer, an oblique style can be generated from the normal font and used to simulate an italic font.  The following illustration shows the normal, italic, and oblique font styles for the Palatino Linotype font. Notice how the italic font style has a more flowing and visually appealing appearance than the oblique font style, which is simply created by skewing the normal font style version of the text.Note?? Values other than the ones defined in the enumeration are considered to be invalid, and they are rejected by font API functions.

            Represents the density of a typeface, in terms of the lightness or heaviness of the strokes. The enumerated values correspond to the usWeightClass definition in the OpenType specification. The usWeightClass represents an integer value between 1 and 999. Lower values indicate lighter weights; higher values indicate heavier weights.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            Weight differences are generally differentiated by an increased stroke or thickness that is associated with a given character in a typeface, as compared to a "normal" character from that same typeface. 	
            The following illustration shows an example of Normal and UltraBold weights for the Palatino Linotype typeface.Note??Not all weights are available for all typefaces. When a weight is not available for a typeface, the closest matching weight is returned.Font weight values less than 1 or greater than 999 are considered invalid, and they are rejected by font API functions.

            <remarks>	
            This function creates a DirectWrite factory object that is used for subsequent creation of individual DirectWrite objects. DirectWrite factory contains internal state data such as font loader registration and cached font data. In most cases it is recommended you use the shared factory object, because it allows multiple components that use DirectWrite to share internal DirectWrite state data, and thereby reduce memory usage. However, there are cases when it is desirable to reduce the impact of a component, such as a plug-in from an untrusted source, on the rest of the process, by sandboxing and isolating it from the rest of the process components. In such cases, it is recommended you use an isolated factory for the sandboxed component.The following example shows how to create a shared DirectWrite factory.<code>	
             if (SUCCEEDED(hr))	
            { hr = <see cref="M:SharpDX.DirectWrite.DWrite.CreateFactory(SharpDX.DirectWrite.FactoryType,System.Guid,SharpDX.ComObject)"/>( <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectWrite.FactoryType.Shared"/>, __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.Factory"/>), reinterpret_cast&lt;<see cref="T:SharpDX.ComObject"/>**&gt;(&amp;pDWriteFactory_) );

            <remarks>	
            A font family is a set of fonts that share the same family name, such as "Times New Roman", but that differ in features. These feature differences include style, such as italic, and weight, such as bold.  The following illustration shows examples of fonts that are members of the "Times New Roman" font family.An <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.FontFamily"/> object can be retrieved from a font collection using the  <see cref="M:SharpDX.DirectWrite.FontCollection.GetFontFamily(System.Int32)"/> method shown in the following example.  GetFontFamily takes a UINT32 index and returns the font family for the font at that index.<code>	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.FontFamily"/>* pFontFamily = <c>null</c>; // Get the font family.	
            if (SUCCEEDED(hr))	
            { hr = pFontCollection-&gt;GetFontFamily(i, &amp;pFontFamily);	
            }	
            	
            </code>The font family name is used to specify the font family for text layout and text format objects.  You can get a list of localized font family names from an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.FontFamily"/> object in the form of an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.LocalizedStrings"/> object by using the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DirectWrite.FontFamily.GetFamilyNames(SharpDX.DirectWrite.LocalizedStrings@)"/> method, as shown in the following code.<code>	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.LocalizedStrings"/>* pFamilyNames = <c>null</c>; // Get a list of localized strings for the family name.	
            if (SUCCEEDED(hr))

            <summary>	
            Specifies how the alpha value of a bitmap or render target should be treated.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            The <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode"/> enumeration is used with the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.PixelFormat"/> enumeration to specify the alpha mode of a render target or bitmap. Different render targets and bitmaps support different alpha modes. For a list, see Supported Pixel Formats and Alpha Modes.The Differences Between Straight and Premultiplied AlphaWhen describing an RGBA color using straight alpha, the alpha value of the color is stored in the alpha channel. For example, to describe a red color that is 60% opaque, you'd use the following values: (255, 0, 0, 255 * 0.6) = (255, 0, 0, 153). The 255 value indicates full red, and 153 (which is 60 percent of 255) indicates that the color should have an opacity of 60 percent.When describing an RGBA color using premultiplied alpha, each color is multiplied by the alpha value: (255 * 0.6, 0 * 0.6, 0 * 0.6, 255 * 0.6) = (153, 0, 0, 153).Regardless of the alpha mode of the render target, D2D1_COLOR_F values are always interpreted as straight alpha.  For example, when specifying the color of an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.SolidColorBrush"/> for use with a bitmap that uses the premultiplied alpha mode, you'd specify the color just as you would if the bitmap used straight alpha. When you paint with the brush, Direct2D translates the color to the destination format for you.Alpha Mode for Render TargetsRegardless of the alpha mode setting, a render target's contents support transparency. For example, if you draw a partially transparent red rectangle with a render target with an alpha mode of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Ignore"/>, the rectangle will appear pink (if the background is white), as you might expect.If you draw a partially transparent red rectangle when the alpha mode is <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Premultiplied"/>, the rectangle will appear pink (assuming the background is white) and you can see through it to whatever is behind the render target. This is useful when using a <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.DeviceContextRenderTarget"/> to render to a transparent window or when using an compatible render target (a render targeted created by the CreateCompatibleRenderTarget method) to create a bitmap that supports transparency.ClearType and Alpha ModesIf you specify an alpha mode other than <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Ignore"/> for a render target, the text antialiasing mode automatically changes from <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.TextAntialiasMode"/> CLEARTYPE to <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.TextAntialiasMode"/> GRAYSCALE. (When you specify an alpha mode of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Unknown"/>, Direct2D sets the alpha for you depending on the type of render target. For a list of what the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Unknown"/> setting resolves to for each render target, see the Supported Pixel Formats and Alpha Modes overview.)You can use the SetTextAntialiasMode method to change the text antialias mode  back to <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.TextAntialiasMode"/> CLEARTYPE, but rendering ClearType text to a transparent surface can create unpredictable results. If you want to render ClearType text to an transparent render target, we recommend that you use one of the following two techniques.Use the PushAxisAlignedClip method to clip the render target to the area where the text will be rendered,    then call the Clear method and specify an opaque color, then render your text. Use DrawRectangle to draw an opaque rectangle behind the area where the text will be rendered.

            <remarks>	
            To stretch an image, each pixel in the original image must be mapped to a group of pixels in the larger image. To shrink an image, groups of pixels in the original image must be mapped to single pixels in the smaller image. The effectiveness of the algorithms that perform these mappings determines the quality of a scaled image. Algorithms that produce higher-quality scaled images tend to require more processing time. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapInterpolationMode.NearestNeighbor"/> provides faster but lower-quality interpolation, while <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapInterpolationMode.Linear"/> provides higher-quality interpolation.

            If <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapOptions.None"/> is specified, the bitmap can be used for drawing but  cannot be set as a target and cannot be read by the CPU.If <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapOptions.Target"/> is specfied, the bitmap can be used as a target for <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.DeviceContext.SetTarget(SharpDX.Direct2D1.Image)"/>.D2D1_BITMAP_OPTIONS_CANNOT_DRAW must be specified in conjunction with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapOptions.Target"/>. If specified, the bitmap can be used as a target but it cannot be drawn from.  Attempting to draw with a bitmap that has this flag set will result in the device context returning the error <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.ResultCode.BitmapCannotDraw"/>.If <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapOptions.CpuRead"/> is specified, the bitmap can be mapped using <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Bitmap1.Map(SharpDX.Direct2D1.MapOptions)"/>. This flag requires <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapOptions.CannotDraw"/> and cannot be combined with any other flags. The bitmap must be updated with either CopyFromBitmap or CopyFromRenderTarget.D2D1_BITMAP_OPTIONS_GDI_COMPATIBLE specifies that a Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) device context associated with this bitmap is available.  This must be used in conjunction with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapOptions.Target"/>. The <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Format"/> must be either <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm_SRgb"/>.

            Use the distant-diffuse lighting effect to create an image that appears to be a reflective surface with where the light source appears to be coming from a long distance (like the sun or overhead lights) and the light is reflecting in all directions. This effect uses the alpha channel as a height map and lights the image with a distant light source. The color of the output bitmap is a result of light color, light position, and the surface geometry of the image.

            Use the distant-diffuse lighting effect to create an image that appears to be a reflective surface with where the light source appears to be coming from a long distance (like the sun or overhead lights) and the light is reflecting in all directions. This effect uses the alpha channel as a height map and lights the image with a distant light source. The color of the output bitmap is a result of light color, light position, and the surface geometry of the image.

            <summary>	
            Specifies whether Direct2D provides synchronization for an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Factory"/> and the resources it creates, so that they may be safely accessed from multiple threads.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            When you create a factory, you can specify whether it is multithreaded or singlethreaded. A singlethreaded factory provides no serialization against any other single threaded instance within Direct2D, so this mechanism provides a very large degree of scaling on the CPU.You can also create a multithreaded factory instance. In this case, the factory and all derived objects can be used from any thread, and each render target can be rendered to independently. Direct2D serializes calls to these objects, so a single multithreaded Direct2D instance won't scale as well on the CPU as many single threaded instances. However, the resources can be shared within the multithreaded instance.Note the qualifier "On the CPU": GPUs generally take advantage of fine-grained parallelism more so than CPUs. For example, multithreaded calls from the CPU might still end up being serialized when being sent to the GPU; however, a whole bank of pixel and vertex shaders will run in parallel to perform the rendering.

            Specifies how the intersecting areas of geometries or figures are combined to form the area of the composite geometry.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            Use the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.FillMode"/> enumeration when creating an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GeometryGroup"/> with the CreateGeometryGroup method, or when modifying the fill mode of an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.SimplifiedGeometrySink"/> with the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.SimplifiedGeometrySink.SetFillMode(SharpDX.Direct2D1.FillMode)"/> method.Direct2D fills the interior of a path by using one of the two fill modes specified by this enumeration: <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.FillMode.Alternate"/> (alternate) or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.FillMode.Winding"/> (winding). Because the modes determine how to fill the interior of a closed shape, all shapes are treated as closed when they are filled.  If there is a gap in a segment in a shape, draw an imaginary line to close it.To see the difference between the winding and alternate fill modes, assume that you have four circles with the same center and a different radius, as shown in the following illustration. The first one has the radius of 25, the second 50, the third 75, and the fourth 100.The following  illustration shows the shape filled by using the alternate fill mode. Notice that the center and third ring are not filled. This is because a ray drawn from any point in either of those two rings passes through an even number of segments.The following illustration explains this process.The following illustration shows how the same shape is filled when the winding fill mode is specified.Notice that all the rings are filled. This is because all the segments run in the same direction, so a ray drawn from any point will cross one or more segments, and the sum of the crossings will not equal zero.The following illustration explains this process. The red arrows represent the direction in which the segments are drawn and the black arrow represents an arbitrary ray that runs from a point in the innermost ring. Starting with a value of zero, for each segment that the ray crosses, a value of one is added for every clockwise intersection. All points lie in the fill region in this illustration, because the count does not equal zero.

            <remarks>	
            Interpolating in a linear gamma space (<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Gamma.Linear"/>) can avoid changes in perceived brightness caused by the effect of gamma correction in spaces where the gamma is not 1.0, such as the default sRGB color space, where the gamma is 2.2. For an example of the differences between these two blending modes, consider the following illustration, which shows two gradients, each of which blends from red to blue to green:The first gradient is interpolated linearly in the space of the render target (sRGB in this case), and one can see the dark bands between each color. The second gradient uses a gamma-correct linear interpolation, and thus does not exhibit the same variations in brightness.

            <remarks>	
            ClearType antialiasing must use the current contents of the render target to blend properly. When a pushed layer requests initializing for ClearType, Direct 2D copies the current contents of the render target into the layer so that ClearType antialiasing can be performed. Rendering ClearType text into a transparent layer does not produce the desired results.A small performance hit from re-copying content occurs when <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.Clear(System.Nullable{SharpDX.Color4})"/> is called.

            A miter limit affects how sharp miter joins are allowed to be. If the line join style is <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.LineJoin.MiterOrBevel"/>, then the join will be mitered with regular angular vertices if it doesn't extend beyond the miter limit; otherwise, the line join will be beveled.The following illustration shows  different line join settings for the same stroked path geometry.

            <remarks>	
            It is important to distinguish between the geometry being stroked and the shape of the stroke pen. When <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.StrokeTransformType.Fixed"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.StrokeTransformType.Hairline"/> is specified, the geometry still respects the transform and dpi, but the pen that traces the geometry will not.

            <remarks>	
            This enumeration is used with the SetTextAntialiasMode of an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget"/> to specify how text and glyphs are antialiased.By default, Direct2D renders text in ClearType mode. Factors that  can downgrade the default quality to grayscale or aliased:If the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.RenderingMode"/> value  is <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectWrite.RenderingMode.Aliased"/> , then the  default text antialiasing mode is aliased.  To change the DirectWrite rendering mode of an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget"/>, use the  <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.SetTextRenderingParams(SharpDX.DirectWrite.RenderingParams)"/> method.  If the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectWrite.RenderingMode"/> value is <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectWrite.RenderingMode.Outline"/>, then the default text  antialiasing mode is grayscale. If the render target has an alpha channel and is not set to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Ignore"/>, then  the default text antialiasing mode is grayscale. If <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.PushLayer(SharpDX.Direct2D1.LayerParameters@,SharpDX.Direct2D1.Layer)"/> is called without <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.LayerOptions.InitializeForCleartype"/> (and the corresponding PopLayer has not  been called yet), then the default text  antialiasing mode is grayscale.

            <remarks>	
            Creating <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.DeviceContextRenderTarget"/> ObjectsTo create an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.DeviceContextRenderTarget"/>, use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Factory.CreateDCRenderTarget(SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetProperties@,SharpDX.Direct2D1.DeviceContextRenderTarget)"/> method.Before you can render with the DC render target, you must use its BindDC method to associate it with a GDI DC.  You do this each time you  use a different DC, or the size of the area you want to draw to changes.To enable the DC render target to work with GDI, set its pixel format to <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm"/> and its alpha mode to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Premultiplied"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Ignore"/>.Your application should create render targets once and hold onto them for the life of the application or until the render target's  EndDraw method returns the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.ResultCode.RecreateTarget"/> error. When you receive this error, you need to recreate the render target (and any resources it created).ID2D1DCRenderTargets, GDI Transforms, and Right-to-Left Language Builds of WindowsWhen you use an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.DeviceContextRenderTarget"/>, it renders Direct2D content to an internal bitmap, and then renders the bitmap to the DC with GDI.It's possible for GDI to apply a GDI transform  (through the SetWorldTransform method) or other effect to the same DC used by the render target, in which case GDI transforms the bitmap produced by Direct2D. Using a GDI transform to transform the Direct2D content has the potential to degrade the visual quality of the output, because you're transforming a bitmap for which antialiasing and subpixel positioning have already been calculated.For example, suppose you use the render target to draw a scene that contains antialiased geometries and text. If you use a GDI transform to apply a scale transform to the DC and scale the scene so that it's 10 times larger, you'll see pixelization and jagged edges. (If, however, you applied a similar transform using Direct2D, the visual quality of the scene would not be degraded.)In some cases, it might not be obvious that GDI is performing additional processing that might degrade the quality of the Direct2D content. For example, on a right-to-left (RTL) build of Windows, content rendered by an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.DeviceContextRenderTarget"/> might be horizontally inverted when GDI copies it to its destination.   Whether the content is actually inverted depends on the current settings of the DC.Depending on the type of content being rendered, you might want to prevent the inversion. If the Direct2D content includes ClearType text, this inversion will degrade the quality of the text.You can control RTL rendering behavior by using the SetLayout GDI function.  To  prevent the mirroring, call the SetLayout GDI function and specify LAYOUT_BITMAPORIENTATIONPRESERVED as the only value for the second parameter (do not combine it with LAYOUT_RTL), as shown in the following example:<code>	
            SetLayout(m_hwnd, LAYOUT_BITMAPORIENTATIONPRESERVED);	
            </code>

            The <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GeometrySink"/> interface extends the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.SimplifiedGeometrySink"/> interface to add support for arcs and quadratic beziers, as well as functions for adding single lines and cubic beziers.A geometry sink consists of one or more figures. Each figure is made up of one or more line, curve, or arc segments. To create a figure, call the BeginFigure method, specify the figure's start point, and then use its Add methods (such as AddLine and AddBezier) to add segments. When you are finished adding segments, call the EndFigure method. You can repeat this sequence to create additional figures. When you are finished creating figures, call the Close method.

            Do not close the geometry sink while a figure is still in progress; doing so puts the geometry sink in an error state. For the close operation to be successful, there must be one EndFigure call for each call to BeginFigure.After calling this method, the geometry sink might not be usable. Direct2D implementations of this interface do not allow the geometry sink to be modified after it is closed, but other implementations might not impose this restriction.

            <remarks>	
            To create a layer, call the CreateLayer method of the render target where the layer will be used. To draw to a layer, push the layer to the render target stack by calling the PushLayer method. After you have finished drawing to the layer, call the PopLayer method.Between  PushLayer and PopLayer calls, the layer is in use and cannot be used by another render target.If the size of the layer is not specified, the corresponding PushLayer call determines the minimum layer size, based on the layer content bounds and the geometric mask. The layer resource can be larger than the size required by PushLayer without any rendering artifacts.If the size of a layer is specified, or if the layer has been used and the required backing store size as calculated during PushLayer is larger than the layer, then the layer resource is expanded on each axis monotonically to ensure that it is large enough. The layer resource never shrinks in size.Creating <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Layer"/> ObjectsTo create a layer, call the CreateLayer method of the render target where the layer will be used.A layer is a device-dependent resource: your application should create layers after it initializes the render target with which the layers will be used, and recreate the layers whenever the render target needs recreated.

            An <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.LinearGradientBrush"/> paints an area with a linear gradient along a line between the brush start point and end   point. The gradient, defined by the brush <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GradientStopCollection"/>, is extruded perpendicular to this line, and then transformed by a brush transform (if specified).The start point and end   point are described in the brush space and are mappped to the render target when the brush is used. Note the starting and ending coordinates are absolute, not relative to the render target size. A value of (0, 0) maps to the upper-left corner of the render target, while a value of (1, 1) maps one pixel diagonally away from (0, 0). If there is a nonidentity brush transform or render target transform, the brush start point and end point are also transformed.It is possible to specify a gradient axis that does not completely fill the area that is being painted. When this occurs, the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.ExtendMode"/>, specified by the   <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GradientStopCollection"/>, determines how the remaining area is painted.Creating <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.LinearGradientBrush"/> ObjectsTo create a linear gradient brush, use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.CreateLinearGradientBrush(SharpDX.Direct2D1.LinearGradientBrushProperties,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct2D1.BrushProperties},SharpDX.Direct2D1.GradientStopCollection,SharpDX.Direct2D1.LinearGradientBrush)"/> method of the render target on which the brush will be used.

            <summary>	
            Paints an area with a radial gradient.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            The <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RadialGradientBrush"/> is similar to the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.LinearGradientBrush"/> in that they both map a collection of gradient stops to a gradient. However, the linear gradient has a start and an end point to define the gradient vector, while the radial gradient uses an ellipse and a gradient origin to define its gradient behavior. To define the position and size of the ellipse, use the SetCenter, SetRadiusX, and SetRadiusY methods to specify the center, x-radius, and y-radius of the ellipse. The gradient origin is the center of the ellipse, unless a gradient offset is specified by using the SetGradientOriginOffset method.The brush maps the gradient stop position 0.0f of the gradient origin, and the position 1.0f is mapped to the ellipse boundary. When the gradient origin is within the ellipse, the contents of the ellipse enclose the entire [0, 1] range of the brush gradient stops. If the gradient origin is outside the bounds of the ellipse, the brush still works, but its gradient is not well-defined.The start point and end point are described in the brush space and are mappped to the render target when the brush is used. Note the starting and ending coordinates are absolute, not relative to the render target size. A value of (0, 0) maps to the upper-left corner of the render target, while a value of (1, 1) maps just one pixel diagonally away from (0, 0). If there is a nonidentity brush transform or render target transform, the brush ellipse and gradient origin are also transformed.It is possible to specify an ellipse that does not completely fill area being painted. When this occurs,       the            <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.ExtendMode"/> and  setting (specified by the  brush     <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.GradientStopCollection"/>) determines how the remaining area is painted.Creating <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RadialGradientBrush"/> ObjectsTo create a radial gradient brush, use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.CreateRadialGradientBrush(SharpDX.Direct2D1.RadialGradientBrushProperties@,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct2D1.BrushProperties},SharpDX.Direct2D1.GradientStopCollection,SharpDX.Direct2D1.RadialGradientBrush)"/> method of the render target on which the brush will be used. The brush may be used only with the render target that created it or with the compatible targets for that render target.A radial gradient brush is a device-dependent resource: your application should create radial gradient brushes after it initializes the render target with which the brushes will be used, and recreate the brushes whenever the render target needs recreated. (For more information about resources, see Resources Overview.)

            Renders drawing instructions to a window.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            As is the case with other render targets, you must call BeginDraw before issuing drawing commands. After you've finished drawing, call EndDraw to indicate that drawing is finished and to release access to the buffer backing the render target. For <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.WindowRenderTarget"/>, the only side effect of BeginDraw is changing the state of the render target to allow drawing commands to be issued. EndDraw flushes any batched drawing commands. If no errors have occurred, then it also presents the buffer, causing it to appear on the associated window. Finally, EndDraw returns the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Result"/> of the first error that occurred in drawing or presenting, as well as the tag state at the time the error occurred.ID2D1HwndRenderTarget objects are double buffered, so drawing commands issued do not appear immediately, but rather are performed on an offscreen surface. When EndDraw is called, if there have been no rendering errors, the offscreen buffer is presented. If there have been rendering errors in the batch flushed by EndDraw, then the buffer is not presented, and the application must call BeginDraw and re-draw the frame. Flush can be used to check for errors before calling EndDraw if an application wants the frame to be presented regardless of errors.A hardware render target's back-buffer is the size specified by GetPixelSize. If EndDraw presents the buffer, this bitmap is stretched to cover the surface where it is presented: the entire client area of the window. This stretch is performed using bilinear filtering if the render target is rendering in hardware and using nearest-neighbor filtering if the rendering target is using software. (Typically, an application will call Resize to ensure the pixel size of the render target and the pixel size of the destination match, and no scaling is necessary, though this is not a requirement.)In the case where a window straddles adapters, Direct2D ensures that the portion of the off-screen render target is copied from the adapter where rendering is occurring to the adapter that needs to display the contents. If the adapter a render target is on has been removed or the driver upgraded while the application is running, this is returned as an error in the EndDraw call. In this case, the application should create a new render target and resources as necessary.Creating <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.WindowRenderTarget"/> ObjectsTo create an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.WindowRenderTarget"/>, use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Factory.CreateHwndRenderTarget(SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetProperties@,SharpDX.Direct2D1.HwndRenderTargetProperties,SharpDX.Direct2D1.WindowRenderTarget)"/> method.Your application should create render targets once and hold onto them for the life of the application or until the render target's  EndDraw method returns the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.ResultCode.RecreateTarget"/> error. When you receive this error, you need to recreate the render target (and any resources it created).

            When you create a render target and hardware acceleration is available, you allocate resources on the computer's GPU. By creating a render target once and retaining it as long as possible, you gain performance benefits. Your application should create render targets once and hold onto them for the life of the application or until the {{D2DERR_RECREATE_TARGET}} error is received. When you receive this error, you need to recreate the render target (and any resources it created).

            Represents a cubic bezier segment drawn  between two points.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            A cubic Bezier curve is defined by four points: a start point, an end point (point3), and two control points (point1 and point2). A Bezier segment does not contain a property for the starting point of the curve; it defines only the end point. The beginning point of the curve is the current point of the path to which the Bezier curve is added.The two control points of a cubic Bezier curve behave like magnets, attracting portions of what would otherwise be a straight line toward themselves and producing a curve. The first control point, point1, affects the beginning portion of the curve; the second control point, point2, affects the ending portion of the curve.Note??The curve doesn't necessarily pass through either of the control points; each control point moves its portion of the line toward itself, but not through itself.

            <summary>	
            Contains the position and color of a gradient stop.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            Gradient stops can be specified in any order if they are at different positions. Two stops may share a position. In this case, the first stop specified is treated as the "low" stop (nearer 0.0f) and subsequent stops are treated as "higher" (nearer 1.0f). This behavior is useful if a caller wants an instant transition in the middle of a stop.Typically, there are at least two points in a collection, although creation with only one stop is permitted. For example, one point is at position 0.0f, another point is at position 1.0f, and additional points are distributed in the [0, 1] range. Where the gradient progression is beyond the range of [0, 1], the stops are stored, but may affect the gradient.When drawn, the [0, 1] range of positions is mapped to the brush, in a brush-dependent way. For details, see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.LinearGradientBrush"/> and <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RadialGradientBrush"/>.Gradient stops with a position outside the [0, 1] range cannot be seen explicitly, but they can still affect the colors produced in the [0, 1] range. For example, a two-stop gradient 0.0f, Black}, {2.0f, White is indistinguishable visually from 0.0f, Black}, {1.0f, Mid-level gray. Also, the colors are clamped before interpolation.

            <remarks>	
            Use this method when creating new <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.LinearGradientBrush"/> objects with the CreateLinearGradientBrush method. For convenience, Direct2D provides the D2D1::LinearGradientBrushProperties helper function for creating new <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.LinearGradientBrushProperties"/> structures.The following illustration shows how a linear gradient changes as you change its start and end points.  For the first gradient, the start point is set to (0,0) and the end point to (150, 50); this creates a diagonal gradient that starts at the upper-left corner and extends to the lower-right corner of the area being painted. When you set the start point to (0, 25) and the end point to (150, 25), a horizontal gradient is created. Similarly, setting the start point  to (75, 0) and the end point to (75, 50) creates a vertical gradient. Setting the start point to  (0, 50) and the end point to (150, 0)  creates a diagonal gradient that starts at the lower-left corner and extends to the upper-right corner of the area being painted.

            Describes limitations to be applied to an imaging effect renderer.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            The renderer can allocate tiles larger than the minimum tile allocation. The allocated tiles will be powers of two of the minimum size on each axis, except that the size on each axis will not exceed the guaranteed maximum texture size for the device feature level.The minimumPixelRenderExtent is the size of the square tile below which the renderer will expand the tile allocation rather than attempting to subdivide the rendering tile any further. When this threshold is reached, the allocation tile size is expanded. This might occur repeatedly until rendering can either proceed or it is determined that the graph cannot be rendered.The buffer precision is used for intermediate buffers if it is otherwise unspecified by the effects or the internal effect topology. The application can also use the Output.BufferPrecision method to specify the output precision for a particular effect. This takes precedence over the context precision. In addition, the effect might set a different precision internally if required. If the buffer type on the context is <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.BufferPrecision.Unknown"/> and otherwise not specified by the effect or transform, the precision of the output will be the maximum precision of the inputs to the transform. The buffer precision does not affect the number of channels used.

            <remarks>	
            Use this structure when creating a render target, or use it with the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget.IsSupported(SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetProperties@)"/> method to check the properties supported by an existing render target.As a convenience, Direct2D provides the D2D1::RenderTargetProperties helper function for creating <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetProperties"/> structures. An easy way to create a <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetProperties"/> structure that works for most render targets is to call the function without specifying any parameters. Doing so creates a <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetProperties"/> structure that has its fields set to default values. For more information, see   D2D1::RenderTargetProperties.Not all render targets support hardware rendering. For a list, see the Render Targets Overview.Using Default DPI SettingsTo use the default DPI, set dpiX and dpiY to 0. The default DPI varies depending on the render target:For a compatible render target, the default DPI is the DPI of the parent render target. For a <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.WindowRenderTarget"/>, the default DPI is the system DPI obtained from the render target's <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Factory"/>. For other render targets, the default DPI is 96.To use the default DPI setting, both dpiX and dpiY must be set to 0. Setting only one value to 0 causes an  E_INVALIDARG error when attempting to create a render target.

            </summary>
            <param name="type">A value that specifies whether the render target should force hardware or software rendering. A value of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetType.Default"/> specifies that the render target should use hardware rendering if it is available; otherwise, it uses software rendering. Note that WIC bitmap render targets do not support hardware rendering.</param>
            <param name="pixelFormat">The pixel format and alpha mode of the render target. You can use the {{D2D1::PixelFormat}} function to create a pixel format that specifies that Direct2D should select the pixel format and alpha mode for you. For a list of pixel formats and alpha modes supported by each render target, see {{Supported Pixel Formats and Alpha Modes}}.</param>
            <param name="dpiX">The horizontal DPI of the render target.  To use the default DPI, set dpiX and dpiY to 0. For more information, see the Remarks section. 	</param>
            <param name="dpiY">The vertical DPI of the render target. To use the default DPI, set dpiX and dpiY to 0.  For more information, see the Remarks section. 	</param>
            <param name="usage">A value that specifies how the render target is remoted and whether it should be GDI-compatible.  Set to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetUsage.None"/> to create a render target that is not compatible with GDI and uses Direct3D command-stream remoting if it  is available.</param>
            <param name="minLevel">A value that specifies the minimum Direct3D feature level required for hardware rendering. If the specified minimum level is not available, the render target uses software rendering if the type  member is set to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTargetType.Default"/>; if  type  is set to to D2D1_RENDER_TARGET_TYPE_HARDWARE, render target creation fails. A value of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct2D1.FeatureLevel.Level_DEFAULT"/> indicates that Direct2D should determine whether the Direct3D feature level of the device is adequate. This field is used only when creating <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.WindowRenderTarget"/> and <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct2D1.DeviceContextRenderTarget"/> objects.	</param>

            <remarks>	
            Each corner of the rectangle specified by the rect is replaced with a quarter ellipse, with a radius in each direction specified by radiusX and radiusY.If the radiusX is greater than or equal to half the width of the rectangle, and the radiusY is greater than or equal to one-half the height, the rounded rectangle is an ellipse with the same width and height of the rect.Even when both radiuX and radiusY are zero, the rounded rectangle is different from a rectangle., When stroked, the corners of the rounded rectangle are roundly joined, not mitered (square).
