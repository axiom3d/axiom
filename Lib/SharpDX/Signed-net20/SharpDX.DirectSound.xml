If the effect is not available in hardware, <see cref="M:SharpDX.DirectSound.SecondarySoundBuffer.SetEffect(System.Int32,SharpDX.DirectSound.SoundBufferEffectDescription[],SharpDX.DirectSound.SoundEffectResult[])"/> raises an error. Since DirectX 9.0, DirectX does not support hardware acceleration of effects, so this flag should not be used.	
             DSFX_LOCSOFTWARE	
            Effect must be in software, even if the hardware supports acceleration of guidDSFXClass. If the effect is not available in software, SetFX raises an error. Since DirectX 9.0, all effects are in software regardless of whether this flag is set.

If an attempt is made to set a value greater than this, but within the range of accepted values, the parameter is set to the nearest supported value and S_FALSE is returned by IDirectSoundFXParamEq8::SetAllParameters.
