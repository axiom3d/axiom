log4net Strong Name Key Readme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The log4net release builds are strongly named using the log4net.snk key 
file. This file is not distributed as part of the log4net source or 
binary downloads. See the log4net documentation for more details.

Before you can build your own release builds you will need to generate 
a strong name key that identifies your assemblies.

Generating your own strong name key.

Run the SN utility from the .NET Framework SDK as follows:

	sn -k log4net.snk

A new strong name key pair will be created and written to the log4net.snk 
file.
