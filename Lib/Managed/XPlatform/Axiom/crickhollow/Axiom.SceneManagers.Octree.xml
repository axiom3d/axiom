            This class contains several speciliazations of the Ogre::Camera class. It
            implements the getRenderOperation method inorder to return displayable geometry
            for debuggin purposes. It also implements a visibility function that is more granular
            than the default.

            	This is used by the OCtreeSceneManager to determine which child to traverse next when
            finding the appropriate octree to insert the box.  Since it is a loose octree, only the
            center of the box is checked to determine the octant.

            <summary>
            Get the height of a a point on the terrain under/over a givin 3d point. This is
            very useful terrain collision testing, since you can simply select 
            a few locations you would like to test and see if the y value matches the one returned
            by this function.
            
            Just to clarify this does not return the altitude of a generic xyz point, 
            rather it returns the y value (height) of a point with the same x and z values 
            as thoes passed in, that is on the surface of the terrain. 
            To get the Altitude you would do something like 
            float altitude = thePoint.y - GetHeightAt(thePoint, 0);
            
            This has code merged into it from GetTerrainTile() b/c it gives us about 60 fps 
            when testing 1000+ points, to inline it here rather than going through the extra function calls
