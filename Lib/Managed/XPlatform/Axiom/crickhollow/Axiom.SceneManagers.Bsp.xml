               Encapsulates a node in a BSP tree.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
               A BSP tree represents space partitioned by planes . The space which is
               partitioned is either the world (in the case of the root node) or the space derived
               from their parent node. Each node can have elements which are in front or behind it, which are
               it's children and these elements can either be further subdivided by planes,
               or they can be undivided spaces or 'leaf nodes' - these are the nodes which actually contain
               objects and world geometry.The leaves of the tree are the stopping point of any tree walking algorithm,
               both for rendering and collision detection etc.<p/>
               We choose not to represent splitting nodes and leaves as separate structures, but to merge the two for simplicity
               of the walking algorithm. If a node is a leaf, the IsLeaf property returns true and both GetFront() and
               GetBack() return null references. If the node is a partitioning plane IsLeaf returns false and GetFront()
               and GetBack() will return the corresponding BspNode objects.

            	The cluster number of this leaf.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            	Leaf nodes are assigned to 'clusters' of nodes, which are used to group nodes together for
            	visibility testing. There is a lookup table which is used to determine if one cluster of leaves
            	is visible from another cluster. Whilst it would be possible to expand all this out so that
            	each node had a list of pointers to other visible nodes, this would be very expensive in terms
            	of storage (using the cluster method there is a table which is 1-bit squared per cluster, rounded
            	up to the nearest byte obviously, which uses far less space than 4-bytes per linked node per source
            	node). Of course the limitation here is that you have to each leaf in turn to determine if it is visible
            	rather than just following a list, but since this is only done once per frame this is not such a big
            	overhead.

            <remarks>
            	A BspNode can either be a splitting plane (the typical representation of a BSP node) or an undivided
            	region contining geometry (a leaf node). Ogre represents both using the same class for simplicity
            	of tree walking. However it is important that you use this method to determine which type you are dealing
            	with, since certain methods are only supported with one of the subtypes. Details are given in the individual methods.
            	Note that I could have represented splitting / leaf nodes as a class hierarchy but the
            	virtual methods / run-time type identification would have a performance hit, and it would not make the
            	code much (any?) simpler anyway. I think this is a fair trade-off in this case.

            <remarks>
                A map allows multiple values per key, unlike the Hashtable which only allows
                unique keys and only a single value per key.  Multiple values assigned to the same
                key are placed in a "bucket", which in this case is an ArrayList.
                <p/>
                An example of values in a map would look like this:
                Key     Value
                "a"     "Alan"
                "a"     "Adam"
                "b"     "Brien"
                "c"     "Chris"
                "c"     "Carl"
                etc
                <p/>
                Currently, enumeration is the only way to iterate through the values, which is
                more pratical in terms of how the Map works internally anyway.  Intial testing showed
                that inserting and iterating through 100,000 items, the Inserts took ~260ms and a full
                enumeration of them all (with unboxing of the value type stored in the map) took between 16-30ms.

            	Specialisation of the SceneManager class to deal with indoor scenes based on a BSP tree.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            	This class refines the behaviour of the default SceneManager to manage
            	a scene whose bulk of geometry is made up of an indoor environment which
            	is organised by a Binary Space Partition (BSP) tree. 
            	<p/>
            	A BSP tree progressively subdivides the space using planes which are the nodes of the tree.
            	At some point we stop subdividing and everything in the remaining space is part of a 'leaf' which
            	contains a number of polygons. Typically we traverse the tree to locate the leaf in which a
            	point in space is (say the camera origin) and work from there. A second structure, the
            	Potentially Visible Set, tells us which other leaves can been seen from this
            	leaf, and we test their bounding boxes against the camera frustum to see which
            	we need to draw. Leaves are also a good place to start for collision detection since
            	they divide the level into discrete areas for testing.
            	<p/>
            	This BSP and PVS technique has been made famous by engines such as Quake and Unreal. Ogre
            	provides support for loading Quake3 level files to populate your world through this class,
            	by calling the BspSceneManager.LoadWorldGeometry. Note that this interface is made
            	available at the top level of the SceneManager class so you don't have to write your code
            	specifically for this class - just call Root::getSceneManager passing a SceneType of ST_INDOOR
            	and in the current implementation you will get a BspSceneManager silently disguised as a
            	standard SceneManager.

               This method will populate xform with 1 matrix if it does not use vertex blending. If it
               does use vertex blending it will fill the passed in pointer with an array of matrices,
               the length being the value returned from getNumWorldTransforms.

               When a renderable uses vertex blending, it uses multiple world matrices instead of a single
               one. Each vertex sent to the pipeline can reference one or more matrices in this list
               with given weights.
               If a renderable does not use vertex blending this method returns 1, which is the default for 
               simplicity.

               a {-1, 1} view space. Useful for overlay rendering. Normal renderables need
               not override this.

            </summary>
            <remarks> 
            	Leaf nodes are assigned to 'clusters' of nodes, which are used to group nodes together for
            	visibility testing. This data holds a lookup table which is used to determine if one cluster of leaves
            	is visible from another cluster. Whilst it would be possible to expand all this out so that
            	each node had a list of pointers to other visible nodes, this would be very expensive in terms
            	of storage (using the cluster method there is a table which is 1-bit squared per cluster, rounded
            	up to the nearest byte obviously, which uses far less space than 4-bytes per linked node per source
            	node). Of course the limitation here is that you have to each leaf in turn to determine if it is visible
            	rather than just following a list, but since this is only done once per frame this is not such a big
            	overhead.
            	<p/>
            	Each row in the table is a 'from' cluster, with each bit in the row corresponding to a 'to' cluster,
            	both ordered based on cluster index. A 0 in the bit indicates the 'to' cluster is not visible from the
            	'from' cluster, whilst a 1 indicates it is.
            	<p/>
            	As many will notice, this is lifted directly from the Quake implementation of PVS.
