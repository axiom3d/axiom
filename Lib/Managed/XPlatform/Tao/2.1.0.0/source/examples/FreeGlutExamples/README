These are C# ports of some official FreeGLUT examples.  The
originals are available from http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/.

These examples use Tao.FreeGlut, and Tao.OpenGl.  Make sure you
have the appropriate native libraries for your system installed.

These examples are fairly well documented, however, do not take
them to be 'best practices' for .NET FreGLUT development.  The
intent of these ports is as an introduction or as a comparison
against the original native versions.
