The Tao.GlBindGen project is responsible for interpreting the OpenGL
specification files (http://opengl.org/registry) and generating the
respective C# bindings. The current version creates bindings for the
.Net 2.0 or Mono 1.2 runtime.

Tao.GlBindGen started as an internal project for the OpenTK
library but was adapted and cleaned-up for use with Tao. The current
version (2.1.x.x) can interpret the v2.1 specs (x.y denote the
minor and bugfix releases, respectively).

Please, report bugs and problems to the Tao Framework team!

========================= Original Readme =============================

This file holds the tools used to generate Tao's Gl.cs OpenGL
bindings.  The .spec files come from the SGI OpenGL sample
implementation, hosted at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/.

There will eventually be tools here to do some XSLT/XPath-y goodness
on the resulting XML files, which the binding generator can use to
annotate the resulting .cs file with docs and other bits; however,
that's not really necessary to get a first functional release.

Right now, generation requires an installed python and a
C# compiler/runtime.  The simplistic Makefile is set up for generating
on linux, though it should work on windows with only minor
modifications.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:
"Tao.GlBindGen.exe -mode:gl2 -in:../../Specifications -out:. -o:tao"

Pretty self-explanatory, "-o:tao" sets the generator to Tao compatibillity mode, "-in","-out" set the input and output directory, "-mode:gl2" for OpenGL 2.1 bindings. Available parameters to "-mode:gl2,wgl,glu,glx,gl3". Gl2 and wgl work, glu,glx,gl3 are not ready yet.
