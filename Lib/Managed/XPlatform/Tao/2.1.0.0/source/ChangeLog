	* Tao.Sdl - fixed SDL_overlay struct.
	* Tao.Sdl - Added non-CLS compliant methods
	* Tao.Sdl - updated to SDL 1.2.13
	* Tao.Cg - Updated to Cg 2.0
	* Added Tao.FFmpeg, Tao.FreeType, Tao.Platform.X11
	* Fixed uninstall issues with the Windows Installer.
	* Added make build system.
	* Removed prebuild from the build system (still used for GAC functionality).
	* Examples are now OSX bundles.
	* Sdl, OpenGl, Cg, FreeGlut (GLUT actually) work on OSX but the others do not have installers. OpenAl has partial support.
	* Tao.Lua - Updated to 5.1.3
	* Added TaoMediaPlayer as an example for Tao.FFmpeg.
	* Tao.Ode - updated to 0.9.
	* Tao.OpenGl - Optimized cold boot time, by using reflection to reduce jitted LOC. 
	* Tao.OpenGl - Simplified and optimized extension loading (now works on OSX, too). 
	* Tao.OpenGl - Improved call speed for functions that take typed arrays as parameters (e.g. int[], short[], etc.) 
	* Tao.OpenGl - Added ref/out overloads for functions taking pointers. 
	* Tao.OpenGl - Added non-CLS compliant overloads for functions with unsigned parameters (e.g. uint, ushort etc.) 
	* Tao.OpenGl - Reduced the total number of overloads by simplifying the generation process. 
	* Tao.OpenGl - Fixed several bugs in the typemaps (GLbool -> bool, void* (return) -> IntPtr). 
	* NAnt build extended with install function (previously just for package building)
	* pkg-config files (important for distro's! since for example OpenSUSE uses Tao.OpenGL.pc, while Debian uses tao-opengl.pc, hopefully everyone will now start using the later one)
	* OpenAL EFX support
	* WGl extensions repaired

	* other/Prebuild/Prebuild.exe
	- new version places AssemblyInfo.cs into Properties/ directory
	* src/Tao.OpenAl/prebuild.xml
	- added regex to skip AssemblyInfo.cs, since it's now auto-included
	* src/Tao.OpenGl/prebuild.xml

	- removed GlGenerator
	* src/Tao.OpenAl/AUTHORS
	- added Randy, Rob, Dave and myself

2006-10-08  C.J. Adams-Collier  <cjcollier@colliertech.org>
	* prj2make.sh
	- added this file.  This will be used by the build verification
	  tests (http://taobvt.colliertech.org) to verify the msvc build
	- note that the build currently fails.  This is better than the
	  "always fail" case that's currently happening, though.
	
2006-10-07  C.J. Adams-Collier  <cjcollier@colliertech.org>
	* src/Tao.DevIl/prebuild.xml, src/Tao.Ode/prebuild.xml,
	  src/Tao.OpenGl/prebuild.xml, src/Tao.Lua/prebuild.xml -
	  commented <KeyFile> and <XmlDocFile> elements that were causing
	  nant build failure * build.sh - removed GlGenerator from the
	  list to build due to a "File Not Found" error - removed copy
	  commands for builds and docs that are broken
	
2006-10-05  C.J. Adams-Collier  <cjcollier@colliertech.org>
	* clean.sh - created - supposedly reverses make.sh *

Tao.Ode 0.6.0.0 - July 25, 2006:
	Update to ODE 0.6 and conversion to .NET 2.0 essentially complete.
	The ODE 0.6 release consists of many bug fixes and
	improvements since the 0.5 release.
	There are also many documented and undocumented changes in the API.
	Notable changes: CCylinder renamed to Capsule
			 Support for geom offsets added
	This update also includes a patch from Markus Ewald to fix a bug in
	dGeomSetRotation and inspired related changes.  Thanks Markus.
