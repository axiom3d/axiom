Steve Streeting - Developer of the excellent Ogre engine, of which Axiom is based upon.  He is also a 
		supporter of this project, even with his distaste for C# ;).

All people who ever contirbuted code to Ogre, especially the ones who have done considerable chunks, such as plugins, the ATI fragment shader parser, and all the fixes/enhancements that have made it the great engine it is today.
